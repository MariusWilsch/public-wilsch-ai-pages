# Stakes Visibility: A Forcing Function for Task Prioritization
[[david-collaboration]]

## 1. Problem: Tasks Without Stakes

- GitHub board tracks task execution, not task WORTH
- All tasks feel equal - no natural prioritization signal
- Result: "working off tasks" mechanically without knowing what matters
- Missing: the €€€ context that makes client work naturally compelling

## 2. Forcing Function Framework

A forcing function succeeds by transforming the psychological cost of inaction into a force greater than the resistance to action itself. Action becomes natural, not forced.

**The 5 Drivers (from client work success):**
1. **Financial Incentives** - Payment/loss tied to action
2. **Social Consequences** - Reputation, client dissatisfaction at stake
3. **Structural Clarity** - Scope, deliverables, deadlines defined
4. **Visibility** - Progress tracked, colors signal urgency
5. **Ownership** - Single person accountable

**The mechanism that works:** Clarity of Stakes - knowing what a task is WORTH enables conscious prioritization. Not loss aversion, not dopamine - information that lets you know what matters.

## 3. What Stakes Visibility Requires

When looking at any task, three elements must be visible:

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Contract value (€X)** | What's the total €€€ this connects to? | "€15k Workshop" |
| **Contract status** | Paid? Pending? At risk? Renewal? | "In progress - 50% invoiced" |
| **Time-to-money** | When does completing this unlock payment? | "Delivery triggers final 50%" |

## 4. Implementation Direction

**The WHAT (Marius's scope):**
- Tasks must show their contract context
- Stakes visibility creates natural prioritization pressure
- Success = looking at any task shows stakes without extra clicks

**The HOW (David's scope):**
- Mechanism TBD: milestones, labels, project fields, or other
- GitHub milestones are one option (milestone = contract, description = stakes)
- Implementation details to be determined by David
