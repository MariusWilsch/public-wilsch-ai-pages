# Organizational Strategy (Component #3)
[[life-vision]]

---
publish: true
---

E-Myth Business Development Framework, Chapter 14. Defines the structural foundation for a business that runs without the founder.

**Scope:** Organization Chart, Position, Position Contract. Operations Manual belongs to Component #4 (Management Strategy).

---

## Core Principle

**Organize around functions, not personalities.**

> "Most companies organize around personalities rather than around functions. That is, around people rather than accountabilities or responsibilities. The result is almost always chaos."

---

## Artifact 1: Organization Chart

**Reference:** [EMyth Organizational Chart Guide](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/soloforce/emyth-chapters/emyth-organizational-chart-guide)

**Definition:**
A visual structure showing all positions and reporting relationships for the business *when it's done*.

**Key elements:**

1. **Horizontal line** - Shareholders above (outside business), Employees below (inside)

2. **Shareholder = end state** - Where you climb TO. Outside the business. No Position Contract needed.

3. **Design top-down, execute bottom-up:**
   - Design: Shareholder → COO → VPs → Managers → Workers
   - Execute: Start at bottom, prototype, hire, climb UP

4. **All positions when COMPLETE** - Not current state.

5. **Design around functions, not personalities**

**Design question:**
"What functions must exist to deliver the Strategic Objective?"

**Derivation chain:**
```
Strategic Objective
      ↓
FUNCTIONS (categories of work: sales, delivery, finance)
      ↓
RESULTS (what each function must produce)
      ↓
POSITIONS (accountable for those results)
```

**Definitions:**
- **Function** = A category of work the business needs
- **Result** = What that function must produce

**Completeness principle:**
"If position not explicit, results won't come." The org chart describes ALL the work. Nothing in limbo.

---

## Artifact 2: Position

**Reference:** [EMyth Organizational Chart Guide](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/soloforce/emyth-chapters/emyth-organizational-chart-guide) (positions are boxes on the chart)

**Definition:**
A box on the Organization Chart.

**What defines a position:**

1. **Accountability** - What results this position must produce
2. **Reporting** - Which position it reports to
3. **Authority** - What decisions it can/cannot make

**Test question:**
"If this position is empty, what results stop being produced?"

---

## Artifact 3: Position Contract

**Reference:** [EMyth Writing Position Agreements](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/soloforce/emyth-chapters/emyth-writing-position-agreements)

**Definition:**
A document that transfers accountability from company to person. **Not a job description** - a contract.

**What it contains:**

1. **Results to be achieved** - What outcomes must this position produce?
2. **Work accountable for** - What activities is this position responsible for?
3. **Standards for evaluation** - How do we measure if results are achieved?
4. **Signature line** - Person signs, accepting accountability

**Key quote:**
> "A Position Contract is not a job description. It is a contract between the company and an employee, a summary of the rules of the company's game."

**Position Contracts are long-lived** because they define *results*, not tasks.

---

## Tactical vs Strategic Work

- **Tactical:** Doing the work IN a position (making sales calls, writing code)
- **Strategic:** Working ON a position (prototyping the process, improving the system)

Each position has BOTH tactical and strategic work. Moving up doesn't eliminate strategic work - it shifts to the new level.

---

## Process Summary

| Process | Chapter | Runs When |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| BDP Loop | Ch 10 (Foundational) | Continuous while prototyping |
| Training Method | Strategic Objective | During transition (before → after hire) |

**Note:** BDP Loop (Innovate → Quantify → Orchestrate) is foundational - referenced across all components but not defined here.

## Conceptual Relationships

```
Organization Chart (1 per company)
        │
        │ contains (1:N)
        ▼
    Positions (N boxes)
        │
        │ each has (1:1)
        ▼
Position Contracts (accountability documents)
```

| Relationship | Cardinality |
|--------------|-------------|
| Org Chart → Positions | 1 : N |
| Position → Contract | 1 : 1 |
| Person → Positions | 1 : N (initially) |

**Note:** This document covers Stage 1 (Structure). Stages 2-4 involve Operations Manual (Component #4+).

## Transition Lifecycle (Example: Developer Position)

This example uses "Developer" as the position being prototyped and handed off:

```
Before Hire:
  Position: Developer
  You: Tactical (coding) + Strategic (documenting process)

During Transition:
  Position: Developer → Hire doing tactical, you training
  Position: Dev Lead → You now doing tactical + strategic HERE

Fully Transitioned:
  Position: Developer → Hire owns it (tactical + suggests improvements)
  Position: Dev Lead → You own tactical + strategic, prototyping THIS
```

The pattern repeats up the chart until you're only **Shareholder** - outside the business, owning no tactical work.

## Next Steps

1. **Read the PDFs** - Review EMyth Organizational Chart Guide and Position Agreements PDFs
2. **Validate definitions** - Update this document if PDFs reveal additional structure
3. **Create Wilsch AI Org Chart** - Apply framework to define actual positions
