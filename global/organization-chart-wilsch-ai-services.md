# Organization Chart - Wilsch AI Services

[[life-vision]]

The Organization Chart for Wilsch AI Services at **done state** — when the founder operates as Shareholder, outside the business. Framework: Michael Gerber, *The E-Myth Revisited*, Chapter 14.

## Core Principle

**Organize around functions, not personalities.**

> "Most companies organize around personalities rather than around functions. That is, around people rather than accountabilities or responsibilities. The result is almost always chaos."

## AI Agent Pattern

**Innovation:** AI agents are explicit on the org chart because they produce important work.

### Two Modes of Working with AI

| Mode | Description | Human Limit |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interactive** | Human works WITH AI (pair programming, collaborative design) | 3-4 sessions max |
| **Non-Interactive (Orchestration)** | Human spawns autonomous agents, reviews output | Scales vertically (N agents per human) |

### Position AI Modes

| Position | Interactive | Orchestration |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Junior Architect** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (design requires human thinking) |
| **Developer** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Autonomous Coders) |
| **Content Marketer** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Autonomous Marketers) |
| **Bookkeeper** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (AI Bookkeeping Agents) |

### Scaling Model

- 1 Human = 3-4 interactive sessions max
- 1 Human = N autonomous agents (limited by review capacity)
- Need more capacity? Add another human at that position
- Humans scale horizontally, AI agents scale vertically

---

## Work Levels

| Level | IN the system (tactical) | ON the system (strategic) |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Worker** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Manager** | ✅ Yes (some) | ✅ Yes |
| **VP** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes only |
| **COO** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes only |
| **Shareholder** | ❌ No | ✅ Oversight only |

**Climbing the chart:** Each level you climb, you shed tactical work and take on more strategic work.

---

## Special Positions

### System Engineer (Reports to COO)

**Why it exists:** The Claude Code Operating System must be centralized. If each position improves AI behavior independently, you get N divergent systems.

**Accountable for:**
- Improvement Loop (programming wrong AI behavior → deterministically right)
- Unified AI behavior across ALL positions
- Affects: Autonomous Coders, Autonomous Marketers, AI Bookkeeping Agents

**Work type:** Strategic only (ON the system, not IN it)

### Sales Partners (External)

**Why external:** Sales comes through partnerships with people who have industry connections (Thomas, Ulrich, future partners).

**Managed by:** Partner Manager (internal)

**Model:** Partners find and close deals. Wilsch AI delivers.

---

## Handoff Sequence

Prototype from the **bottom up**, hand off, climb the chart:

### VP/Delivery Path
```
1. Developer (you now) → hand off → move up
2. Dev Lead → hand off → move up
3. Solution Architect → hand off → move up
4. VP/Delivery → hand off → move up
5. COO → hand off → Shareholder
```

### Current State (2026-02)
- **Mohamed** being trained as Developer
- **Founder** holds: Solution Architect, Dev Lead, Developer, VP/Delivery, COO, Shareholder

---

## Derivation Chain

```
Strategic Objective
      ↓
FUNCTIONS (what categories of work?)
      ↓
RESULTS (what must each function produce?)
      ↓
POSITIONS (who's accountable?)
```

| Function | Result | VP |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Finding clients | Signed contracts, revenue | VP/Marketing |
| Delivering projects | Finished AI projects deployed | VP/Delivery |
| Managing money | Cash flow, asset growth | VP/Finance |
| Improving AI system | Deterministically correct AI behavior | System Engineer |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Position Contracts** — For each position, define:
   - Results to be achieved
   - Work accountable for
   - Standards for evaluation
   - Signature line

2. **Sign contracts** — Founder signs for all positions currently held

3. **Prototype from bottom** — Start with Developer position (Mohamed)
