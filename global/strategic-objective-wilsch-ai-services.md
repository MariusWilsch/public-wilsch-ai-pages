# Strategic Objective - Wilsch AI Services

[[life-vision]]

The Strategic Objective defines what the business must do to achieve the Primary Aim. Framework: Michael Gerber, *The E-Myth Revisited*, Chapter 13.

---

## The Primary Aim (Summary)

A life lived in conscious system. Finding unknowns, exploring them, building them into systems, handing them off to operators, resting, learning from their use, and beginning again.

**First Cycle Deadline:** End of February 2027

**Financial Target:** €360,000 principal in interest-bearing assets at 10% → €3,000/month → freedom to do cycles without financial pressure

## What the Business Must Do

**The business is a vehicle, not a destination.**

Wilsch AI Services exists to:
1. Generate revenue (to fund the €360k principal for freedom)
2. Provide friction and stakes (something real to work on)
3. Create handoff opportunities (people to receive systems)

The business itself is interchangeable. What matters: it serves as a reliable mechanism for running cycles.

## The Proprietary Operating System

**What we sell (commodity):** Finished AI projects—local deployment, legal automation, whatever the client needs.

**What clients walk away with (product):** Possibility space made tangible. Clients know they have problems but have no idea whether or how AI could solve them. The product is opening that possibility space—showing what's technically feasible before they even think about AI. Translating between business problems and AI capabilities. Making abstract potentials concrete.

**What makes it possible (proprietary method):** The Claude Code Operating System—an internal methodology for producing deterministically correct AI behavior. Clients don't see or learn this system. They experience the result: reliable delivery that proves the possibility space is real.

### The System Components (Handoff Sequence)

**1. Issue Lifecycle Router** — Design doc → finished product execution

**2. Improvement Loop** — Programming wrong AI behavior → deterministically right

**3. Knowledge Extraction (Phase 0)** — Meeting → transcript → design doc → uncertainties? → repeat until design doc complete → create issues

**Test for Alignment:** "Does this make the system run without me?"

**Extended Test:** "Can he improve the behavior of the system without me?"

## Exit Criteria (First Cycle Complete)

Any of these paths completes the first cycle:

| Path | Target | What It Proves |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Revenue machine** | €360k accumulated through client projects | Operators can execute; model scales |
| **Sellable asset** | Business worth ~€360k | System works independently; buyer confidence |
| **OS product launched** | Product generates €360k | Methodology is packageable and valuable |

**Key insight:** The path doesn't matter. What matters is reaching €360k principal through a system that runs without the founder.

## The Operator Model

### Profile

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Thinks like a software engineer** | Can architect systems, not just write code |
| **Has will** | Interested in building, wants to do it |
| **Junior or mid-level dev** | Follows documented processes, learns through repetition |

**Phase 1 Mindset:** Use the system to trial-and-error extremely quickly. Learn on the job. The system makes feedback loops fast — your job is to iterate, not to already know.

### How Learning Works

**The system is a trial-and-error machine.**

The Claude Code Operating System doesn't teach you AI concepts — it makes trial and error so fast that you learn any concept you need on the job.

**How everyone learns:** Try something → doesn't work → try again → works → learned something. This is universal. The question isn't whether to eliminate trial and error (you can't), but how to minimize cycle time.

**What the system does:** Makes feedback loops extremely fast. Code either runs or doesn't. Behavior is correct or isn't. Output meets requirements or doesn't. Each cycle takes minutes, not days.

**What this means for operators:**
- No prior AI knowledge required (RAG, embeddings, local deployment, etc.)
- You learn these concepts when you hit an issue that needs them
- The fast feedback loop means you learn quickly
- Requiring AI expertise upfront would create a bottleneck

**The distinction:**
- AI **behavior** should be deterministically correct (the system ensures this)
- AI **output** will have errors (expected, like any developer's code)

Your job is not to already know. Your job is to iterate.

### Training Method

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mode** | Google Meet together, camera off, voice off by default |
| **Interaction** | Operator unmutes/shares screen when questions arise |
| **Duration** | As many issues as needed until fully independent |
| **Hard cap** | 25 issues — should get it by 10, but 25 max before exit |
| **Principle** | Teaching is more important than founder focus during training period |

### Handoff Sequence

```
Phase 1: Issue Lifecycle Router
  └─ Operator owns: design doc → finished product
  └─ Founder owns: Phase 0 (knowledge extraction) + system improvement
       ↓
Phase 2: Improvement Loop
  └─ Operator owns: flagging friction + fixing AI behavior
  └─ Founder owns: Phase 0 only
       ↓
Phase 3: Full Independence
  └─ Operator owns: execution + improvement
  └─ Founder owns: client relationships + next cycle
```

## Immediate Milestone

**Mohamed operates the full Issue Lifecycle Router.**

| What | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Input** | Design doc (output of Knowledge Extraction loop) |
| **Process** | Full Issue Lifecycle: Creation → Design → Execution → Review → Closing |
| **Output** | Finished product deployed to production |
| **Founder role** | Available on Google Meet, but doesn't touch anything |

**Success criteria:** Mohamed can take a design doc and deliver a finished product without founder intervention.

**Why this matters:** If Mohamed works, the model is proven. A second operator can be trained the same way. The constraint (founder as bottleneck) is removed.

---

## What the Founder Works ON (Not IN)

Once Issue Lifecycle Router is handed off, founder time goes to:

**Knowledge Extraction (until handed off):**
- Scheduling client meetings
- Creating design docs from Knowledge Extraction loop

**Scaling:**
- Training new operators
- Building out systems for future phase handoffs

**Exit path activities:**
- Building asset worth ~€360k (sellable business)
- Building out the OS product (productized methodology)

**No longer doing:**
- ~~Executing issues~~ (handed off)
