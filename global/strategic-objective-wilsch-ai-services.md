# Strategic Objective - Wilsch AI Services

[[life-vision]]

The Strategic Objective defines what the business must do to achieve the Primary Aim. Framework: Michael Gerber, *The E-Myth Revisited*, Chapter 13.

## The Primary Aim (Summary)

A life lived in conscious system. Finding unknowns, exploring them, building them into systems, handing them off to operators, resting, learning from their use, and beginning again.

**First Cycle Deadline:** End of February 2027

**Financial Target:** €360,000 principal → €3,000/month interest → freedom to do cycles without financial pressure

## What the Business Must Do

**The business is a vehicle, not a destination.**

Wilsch AI Services exists to:
1. Generate revenue (to fund the €360k principal for freedom)
2. Provide friction and stakes (something real to work on)
3. Create handoff opportunities (people to receive systems)

The business itself is interchangeable. What matters: it serves as a reliable mechanism for running cycles.

## The Proprietary Operating System

**What we sell (commodity):** Finished AI projects—local deployment, legal automation, whatever the client needs.

**What clients walk away with (product):** Confidence that AI can produce consistent, reliable output. Not magic. Not hype. Deterministically correct behavior.

**What makes it proprietary:** The Claude Code Operating System—a methodology for getting AI to do what you want, predictably, without requiring domain expertise.

### The System Components

| Component | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Issue Lifecycle Router** | Documented | Design doc → finished product execution |
| **Improvement Loop** | Partially documented | Programming wrong AI behavior → deterministically right |
| **Knowledge Extraction** | Ad-hoc (Phase 0) | Client meetings → transcripts → design docs → issues |

**Test for Alignment:** "Does this make the system run without me?"
**Extended Test:** "Can he improve the behavior of the system without me?"

## Exit Criteria (First Cycle Complete)

Any of these paths completes the first cycle:

| Path | Target | What It Proves |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Revenue machine** | €360k accumulated through client projects | Operators can execute; model scales |
| **Sellable asset** | Business worth ~€360k | System works independently; buyer confidence |
| **OS product launched** | Product generates €360k | Methodology is packageable and valuable |

**Key insight:** The path doesn't matter. What matters is reaching €360k principal through a system that runs without the founder.

## The Operator Model

### Profile

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Thinks like a software engineer** | Can architect systems, not just write code |
| **Has will** | Interested in building, wants to do it |
| **Junior dev with guidance** | Follows documented processes, learns through repetition |

**Not required:** Prior Claude Code experience (may actually be counterproductive—brings existing habits).

### Training Method

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mode** | Google Meet together, camera off, voice off by default |
| **Interaction** | Operator unmutes/shares screen when questions arise |
| **Duration** | As many issues as needed until fully independent |
| **Hard cap** | If no progress after threshold, exit |
| **Principle** | Teaching is more important than founder focus during training period |

### Handoff Sequence

```
Phase 1: Issue Lifecycle Router
  └─ Operator owns: design doc → finished product
  └─ Founder owns: Phase 0 (knowledge extraction) + system improvement
       ↓
Phase 2: Improvement Loop
  └─ Operator owns: flagging friction + fixing AI behavior
  └─ Founder owns: Phase 0 only
       ↓
Phase 3: Full Independence
  └─ Operator owns: execution + improvement
  └─ Founder owns: client relationships + next cycle
```

## Immediate Milestone

**Mohamed operates the full Issue Lifecycle Router.**

| What | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Input** | Design doc (created by founder from client knowledge) |
| **Process** | Full Issue Lifecycle: Creation → Design → Execution → Review → Closing |
| **Output** | Finished product deployed to production |
| **Founder role** | Available on Google Meet, but doesn't touch anything |

**Success criteria:** Mohamed can take a design doc and deliver a finished product without founder intervention.

**Why this matters:** If Mohamed works, the model is proven. A second operator can be trained the same way. The constraint (founder as bottleneck) is removed.

## What the Founder Works ON (Not IN)

Once handoff is complete, founder time goes to:

| Activity | Category |
|----------|----------|
| Building/improving the system | Working ON |
| Scheduling client meetings | Working ON |
| Creating design docs from client knowledge | Working ON (Phase 0) |
| Training new operators | Working ON |
| Executing issues | ~~Working IN~~ (handed off) |
