# Developer Position Launch — Deep Dive
[[traceline]]

## Meeting Goal

Deep dive into what's needed to launch the Developer position (Traceline) as a beta by Friday. Yesterday aligned vision and product framing. Today resolves execution: what ships, how users get it, how they succeed.

1. **Plugin scope locked** — every file reviewed with yes/no/needs changes
2. **Launch todo list** — tasks with owners, ordered by Friday deadline
3. **Onboarding path designed** — what a beta user experiences from install to first shipped code

## Discussion Topics

_Starting points for discussion, not limited to these._

### 1. Yesterday's vision check — 5 minutes, then move on

Aligned yesterday:
- Developer position = first product ✓
- Augment-not-replace narrative ✓
- Interactive-first, then autonomous ✓
- Traceline as product name (traceline.dev) ✓

Open:
- Christoph wants to read E-Myth before buying into "profitable businesses" framing
- "Each position = sellable product" strategy needs more thinking
- Quick temperature check, not a re-discussion — if no new thinking, move to Topic 2

### 2. The plugin ships as the beta delivery — what goes in, what stays out

Current state:
- Claude Code plugin = only viable delivery method for speed
- At face value, current plugin is "too scary" for new users
- Claude.md has hardcoded references (Auggie MCP, personal paths) — must be removed
- Mechanism for copying Claude.md to user repos doesn't exist — plugin doesn't do this

Decisions needed:
- Walk through every file: yes / no / needs changes
- For each "needs changes" — what specifically changes and who does it
- What's the smallest file set that still delivers the Developer position experience

### 3. A new beta user's first 5 minutes determine whether they stay or leave

The vision: use Claude Code's `--sdk-url` flag to turn the terminal into a WebSocket connection. Build a scripted walkthrough that guides users through Path A and Path B from the [Developer Operations Manual](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/global/developer-operations-manual-wilsch-ai-services). The user experiences the full lifecycle without reading documentation.

- **Path A** (spec-design): needs context outside the issue → rubber-duck → clarity phases → execute
- **Path B** (spec-implement): everything needed is in the issue → clarity phases → execute
- What does install → first successful action look like?
- `--sdk-url` scripted walkthrough: walk user through one Path A issue and one Path B issue
- What prerequisites must a user have? (GitHub account, Claude API key, repo structure)
- Reference: [The-Vibe-Company/companion](https://github.com/The-Vibe-Company/companion) — SDK-based delivery approach

### 4. Without GitHub, the context trickle system breaks

GitHub Projects is not just a project board — it's the backbone of the context association system.

What the trickle system does:
- **Transcript agent** ([#479](https://github.com/DaveX2001/claude-code-improvements/issues/479)) — automatically matches meeting transcripts to issues
- **Email agent** — matches incoming emails to relevant issues
- **Design docs** link back to issues
- **Commits** reference issues
- Everything stays associated without manual effort

Decisions needed:
- What do beta users lose without GitHub Projects?
- Is the trickle system a core differentiator or nice-to-have for beta?
- Force GitHub for beta (preserves full value) vs optional (lower barrier, loses trickle)?
- What's the minimum GitHub setup a beta user needs?

### 5. The launch todo list is the transcript's real output

Context:
- Yesterday: "I need this as a transcript so I can create an issue and power through until Friday"
- Beta user database needed: Name, Email, GitHub username
- Sources: father's company, Singapore contacts, existing waitlist
- Christoph's warning: "I don't want us to hurry and do it poorly"

Decisions needed:
- What's the minimum viable beta? What can ship without?
- Who does what? Assign every todo to a name
- What's the "done" signal — users installed? Users shipped code? Users gave feedback?
- How many beta users? 5 is intimate, 20 is a real test, 50 is a distribution problem

### 6. We still don't have a word for what we're selling

Yesterday's gap:
- "Assistant" — no differentiation
- "Interaction patterns" — too academic
- "Behavioral scripts" — too clinical
- "Organizational socialization" / "operant conditioning" — accurate but unsellable
- "Pretty cool markdown files" / "Master of Markdown" — playful but risks underselling

The actual depth: each markdown artifact goes through iteration after iteration, refined until deterministic. The output looks simple. The process that produced it isn't.

**Tweakability — the system grows toward whatever you want it to be.**
- Intent (Augment Code) is fixed: spec → agents → code. Can't reshape HOW it works
- Traceline's behavioral triggers (skills, protocols, hooks) are all user-modifiable markdown
- The system bends to your workflow, not the other way around
- Intent gives you a product. Traceline gives you a platform you shape

**The system teaches you by letting you fail fast.**
- The system makes trial and error so fast you learn any concept on the job
- Confidence gates and fast feedback loops mean you learn through doing
- Intent executes FOR you — you don't learn. Traceline executes WITH you — you learn

| Layer | Intent (Augment Code) | Traceline |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Flexibility** | Fixed product | Tweakable platform (behavioral triggers) |
| **Learning** | Executes FOR you | Executes WITH you — you learn on the job |
| **Knowledge** | Resets per project | Compounds across sessions (docstrings, hippocampus, tracking) |
| **Phase 2** | N/A | System improves itself (System Engineer position) |

- What do developers actually buy? A plugin, a workflow, a system, a methodology?
- The positioning must convey both simplicity (just markdown) and the evolutionary refinement cycle
- Roland's input on naming — what did he come back with?
- Reference: [Augment Intent](https://docs.augmentcode.com/intent/overview) — closest competitor, spec-driven development

## Meeting Format

- **Type:** Working session — decisions, not exploration
- **Duration:** ~1.5 hours
- **Attendees:** Marius + Christoph
- **Expectation:** Christoph has plugin repo open. Both ready to make yes/no decisions per file.
- **Outcome:** Transcript that decomposes into a launch issue with assigned todos
