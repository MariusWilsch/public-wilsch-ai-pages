## Position Identification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Position Title** | Developer |
| **Reports To** | Dev Lead |
| **Direct Reports** | Autonomous Coder (AI) × N (future) |

---

## Result Statement

**Define the result this position is accountable for producing:**

> To deliver working solutions to staging that meet design specifications, through task decomposition, design of DoD + AC at task level, implementation against those specifications, and upholding quality standards (sanity checks, AC verification, human witness) including project-specific evaluation systems where needed.

**"Working" defined:** Passes all 3 quality standards (sanity check, AC verification, human witness-technical).

---

## Work Listing

**List all strategic and tactical work for which this position is accountable.**

### Strategic Work (ON the position)

1. Decompose design docs into implementation issues (task decomposition authority)
2. Design DoD + AC for each issue (spec-design at task level)
3. Determine implementation approach within design boundaries
4. Design project-specific evaluation/backpressure mechanisms for AI self-verification
5. Evaluate implementation blockers and escalate design gaps when appropriate
6. Provide input to Dev Lead on delivery progress and friction points

### Tactical Work (IN the position)

1. Create worktrees for issues
2. Implement code against DoD + AC
3. Execute sanity checks
4. Execute AC verification
5. Conduct PR review
6. Deploy to staging environment
7. Conduct human witness (technical validation)
8. Add `review` label for handoff to Dev Lead

---

## Standards

**List quantity, quality, and behavior standards for which this position is accountable.**

### Position-Specific Standards

1. All issues must have DoD + AC defined before implementation begins

2. Code must pass all 3 quality standards (sanity check, AC verification, human witness) AND be deployed to staging before adding `review` label. Code should not stay in worktree.

3. Try at least 3 different approaches (with AI assistance) before escalating design issues to Solution Architect

4. Daily grooming sync with Dev Lead (Google Meet) to surface blockers early; ad-hoc escalation via WhatsApp for urgent issues

5. When implementing AI features, consider and document evaluation/backpressure mechanisms for AI self-verification

6. Keep multiple issues (3-4 worktrees) from the same design doc moving in parallel. One worktree per issue. Focus on one project at a time.

7. After completing human witness (technical validation), post findings as an issue comment — including what was tested, pass/fail per item, and spot-check recommendations for the Dev Lead. This is the handoff artifact.

8. Signal deviations from the design doc or implementation plan via issue comment before adding `review` label. Initiative is valued — invisible deviation is not.

### Company-Wide Standards

1. All work will be performed using documented systems (Operations Manual)

2. All work will be orchestrated and quantified when appropriate

3. Learn through fast trial-and-error using the system; escalate to human only after automated backpressure is exhausted

4. Immediate manager (Dev Lead) will be notified of issues that cannot be resolved before deadlines

## Manager's Commitment

**What the Dev Lead commits to provide:**

### Working Environment
- Claude Code license
- Access to repos, servers, staging environment
- Design docs ready before delegation
- Availability in daily grooming
- Timely reviews (not blocking Developer)

### Necessary Resources
- Operations Manual (documented systems to follow)

### Appropriate Training
- Onboarding period (up to 25 issues as per Strategic Objective)
- Ongoing availability for questions
