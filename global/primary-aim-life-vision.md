# Primary Aim - Life Vision

[[life-vision]]

## The Funeral Recording

*Imagine a room with golden tapestries, subdued lighting, deep carpet. Everyone you've ever mattered to is seated there. At the front, in an ornate box... you. From the corners of the room, a recording of your voice plays. You're telling them the story of your life.*

## Core Vision

**A life lived in conscious system.**

Finding unknowns, exploring them, building them into systems, handing them off to operators, resting, learning from their use, and beginning again.

Not scattered—rhythmic. Not unfinished—finished by handoff.

### The Reframe

What was said as a child: *"You start things and never finish them."*

The truth: *"You start things and you finish them by handing them off."*

The missing piece was never discipline or focus. It was the handoff mechanism. The operators. The infrastructure to leave properly.

## The Rhythm

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Unknown appears** | Something pulls attention. An idea, a problem, a possibility. |
| **2. Explore** | Dive in. Ask questions. Every answer reveals new questions. |
| **3. Build into system** | Turn exploration into something repeatable. Use it yourself first. |
| **4. Hand off** | Transfer to an operator. Document. Train. Let go. |
| **5. Observe** | Watch the operator's friction points. Learn from their use. |
| **6. Improve** | Feed observations back into the system. |
| **7. Rest / Branch** | Pause. Then choose: improve existing OR begin new unknown. |

### Two Paths Forward

After Phase 6, two loops are valid:

1. **Improvement loop** — Operator friction reveals new questions. Improving the existing system IS exploration. Stay in Phases 5-6-7 as long as it pulls you.

2. **New cycle loop** — Improvement stabilizes. A new unknown calls. Return to Phase 1 with something different.

Both serve the same purpose: keeping exploration alive. The choice depends on what pulls you. As mastery develops, multiple cycles can run in parallel.

**Key insight:** Decay happens when you skip Phase 4-7. You build, you use it yourself, interest wanes, you check out. Things rot. The handoff mechanism is what transforms "scattered" into "rhythmic."

## Day-to-Day Structure

*When the macro rhythm is intact, the daily structure follows naturally.*

| Time | Block |
|------|-------|
| 7-8 AM | Wake |
| 8-12 PM | Maker work (focused exploration/building) |
| 12-2 PM | Manager work |
| 2-6 PM | Maker work |
| Evening | Free-form |

**Critical dependency:** This structure only works when you care about something. Caring follows from being in an active exploration phase. When the cycle breaks (stuck in operations, no handoff, no next unknown), the structure collapses.

## First Cycle Deadline

**End of February 2027.**

- First complete cycle finished
- Company operable by others (sold ~€360k or generating equivalent revenue through operations)
- Life system documented and understood
- Ready to start the next cycle

---

## Money

**Role:** Tool for freedom, not goal in itself.

**Target:** €360,000 principal → €3,000/month in interest → freedom to do cycles without financial pressure.

**Path:** First cycle hits this target (either through company sale or accumulated revenue). Each subsequent cycle builds higher.

**Philosophy:** Each cycle adds to principal. Eventually, interest covers baseline life. Cycles become purely about exploration, not survival.

---

## Geographic Rhythm

**Two stable bases.**

Not digital nomad (too much novelty, constant setup). Not fixed in one place (stagnation).

**What the bases provide:**
- Routine already established (no setup, just arrive and start)
- Builders around (people who do work and build)
- Cycle of presence between two locations

**Current direction:** Singapore + Athens (with David). Locations may change; the principle stays.

---

## Relational

**Tribe:** Builders. People who do work and build stuff.

**How to show up:** Reliable and present. Follow through on commitments. Sure about my stuff—sure about the life system.

**Operators:** The people who receive the handoff become part of the cycle. They run what you build. The company sale means they continue operating it.

---

## Learning

**Physical:** Follows from caring. When you care about your work, you care about your body. When you check out, you slide. Physical health is a symptom of cycle health.

**Intellectual:** Fueled by questions. *"A Beautiful Question"* — answers don't matter, only the next question. Every problem solved rewards you with a new problem.

**What to avoid:** The decay trap. Noticing too late that interest has waned. Build early warning signals into the rhythm.

---

## What's Missing (To Be Built)

1. **Cycle awareness** — Know the phases. Walk through them consciously. When you're in a defined cycle, you know where you are—no separate "early warning" needed.

2. **Handoff mechanism** — Documentation, training, operators. The infrastructure to leave properly.

3. **Operator bench** — People who can receive what you create. Always be cultivating receivers.

### The Hotel Model

In *The E-Myth Revisited* (Chapter 15), a hotel owner built an entire Management System—Operations Manual, color-coded checklists, automated lighting synchronized with seasons, every detail orchestrated. Then he handed it to a 29-year-old former short-order cook who had never worked in hotels. The manager runs the system; the owner designed it.

> "Everything I know about the hotel business I've learned here."

That's the model. Build the system. Document it so completely that anyone can run it. Hand it off. Move on.
