# Cloud Code Operating System — Product Vision & Launch Requirements
[[life-vision]]

## Meeting Goal

Align the team on the product vision for the Cloud Code Operating System and determine what's needed to launch the Developer position as our first sellable product.

1. **Shared vision** — everyone understands the end state: franchise prototype at scale
2. **Product roadmap** — agreed sequence of positions as products (6 phases)
3. **Launch requirements** — concrete list of what's needed to sell the Developer position externally

## Discussion Topics

*Starting points for discussion, not limited to these.*

### 1. Take existing, profitable businesses — apply our playbook — earn with them forever

We don't build companies from scratch. Boomer businesses already have revenue, customers, and operations — they just never digitalized. We go in with our E-Myth + AI playbook, systematize every position, and own the result permanently.

- Apply E-Myth org chart + AI + operator → make the owner replaceable
- The systematized business becomes a franchise prototype — replicate it 5,000 times
- Group 5 similar businesses → start raising money
- Not flipping — owning. We earn with these businesses forever
- Evidence: AiTax SG runs an entire company on filesystem + Claude — tax engine, CRM, sales, contracts — 6,000+ files, no SaaS stack
- "Hiring yourself out of a role by AI" — the pitch

### 2. Each position on the org chart is a sellable product

Every position is a deterministic transformation: defined input → defined output, executed by AI + operator. Positions can be sold independently before we sell the entire system.

- Developer: issues → code
- Junior Architect: transcripts → design docs
- One operator can run 3–4 positions — scalability through AI, not headcount
- Product roadmap:
  - **Phase 1:** Developer position (interactive → then autonomous agents)
  - **Phase 2:** System Engineer (Improvement Loop + context graph)
  - **Phase 3–5:** Junior Architect + 2 more positions — prove the model across role types
  - **Phase 6:** Full E-Myth + AI system — Primary Aim through org chart, all positions, all operations manuals. The franchise prototype applied to acquired businesses.

### 3. The proof point has two stages

Internal proof comes first: Wilsch AI runs without Marius operating anything. External proof follows: the same system works on a different business. The internal proof IS the demo for acquisitions.

- **Internal:** Marius at shareholder level — chats with key people, doesn't operate anything
- **External:** Same system applied to a different business and it works there too
- "If we can do it with my company, we can do it with any"
- Timeline: February 2026 → February 2027 (12 months to internal proof)

### 4. Launching Developer position requires solving distribution, onboarding, and portability

Mohamed proves the Developer position works internally. The gap between "works for us" and "we can sell this" has at least three open areas.

- **Distribution model:** How does someone buy a "position"? What's the delivery format?
- **Onboarding:** How do we train an external customer's operator on the system?
- **De-hardcoding:** The system runs on GitHub with Marius's specific setup — needs to be portable
- **Naming/branding idea (from Roland):** "Traceline" — every decision traced from requirement to deployment. Developers get it immediately (traces, stack traces, git history). Enterprise compliance angle: "complete traceline auditability for AI development." Code breaks → follow the traceline. Something works → replicate the traceline. People leave → their tracelines stay. `traceline.dev` likely available.
- Including but not limited to these — the team should surface more

### 5. E-Myth community as natural audience when we have a demo

Gerber built the franchise prototype concept. We're making it executable with AI. When the Developer position runs as a sellable product, the E-Myth community is a natural fit.

- Approach E-Myth practitioners, coaches, or the organization for collaboration
- Show the demo: "Here's a franchise prototype that actually runs on AI"

## Meeting Format

- **Type:** Vision alignment + working session
- **Duration:** ~45 min
- **Attendees:** Full team — David, Mohamed, Thomas, anyone interested in the vision
- **Expectation:** Read Pre-Read links before the meeting
- **Outcome:** Shared understanding of vision + concrete list of launch requirements for Phase 1
