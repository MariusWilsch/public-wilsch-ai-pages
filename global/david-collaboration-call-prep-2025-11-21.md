# Call Prep: Tracking System for Marius & David

**Date:** 2025-11-21
**Goal:** Clarify how the deliverable tracking system should work
**Related:** [[business-operations]]

---

## Section 1: Information Flow
*"How do I get the info to track?"*

- **1.1 Client communication:** Google Meet, Email, Teams Chat, Calling
  - Decision needed with David: which channels to prioritize for tracking
- **1.2 CC on emails:** Yes - CC or BCC possible
- **1.3 Google Meet transcripts:** Yes - can provide access
- **1.4 Messaging platform:** WhatsApp and Teams

---

## Section 2: Marius' Tech Setup
*"So his Claude can read the data"*

- **2.1 Project workspace:** Git and Local (everything local will eventually be in git)
- **2.2 Sharing method:** Decision needed with David:
  - How to share? (Shared Folder, Git, iCloud, Dropbox?)
  - How to visualize? (Kanban, plain file, other?)
- **2.3 Format:** Markdown (easiest for AI to read)

---

## Section 3: Scope
*"How big will the system be?"*

- **3.1 Active projects/clients:** ~7 projects currently
- **3.2 Deliverables per project:** Varies, max 5, typically 1-3 active at a time
  - Solo operation = limited parallel capacity

---

## Section 4: New Deliverable Handoff
*"When something new comes in"*

- **4.1 Where new deliverable docs go:** Currently pen & paper - needs digital location
- **4.2 How David finds out about new deliverables:** *David owns this process*
- **4.3 Who creates the 5-question doc:** *David owns this process*

*Note: 4.2 & 4.3 are core questions FOR David - this is what I'm hiring him to figure out*

---

## Section 5: Status Updates
*"How do I learn about changes?"*

- **5.1 How to report progress:** *David owns this process*
- **5.2 How to report blockers:** *David owns this process*
- **5.3 Client follow-ups:** Marius does them (for now)

---

## Section 6: The Goal
*"What's the dream?"*

- **6.1 The dream:** View of all projects + deliverables + what's stuck + how long - in seconds
  - Not "what should I do today" (that's my decision)
- **6.2 Visual vs Claude query:** Both essential
  - Human needs visual dashboard
  - AI needs queryable format
  - *Core challenge: must work for both*
- **6.3 Main pain point:** No quick visibility into what's stuck across all projects

---

## Section 7: Open Points from Framework
*"These gaps should also be clarified"*

- **7.1 Tracking client-waiting tasks:** *David owns this process*
- **7.2 Priority:** Marius decides
- **7.3 Escalation:** David can escalate + should hold Marius accountable when deadlines slip
