# Manage-Artifact v2 — Instruction Fixing Methodology

[[improve-system-architecture]]

Design doc for redesigning the manage-artifact skill — the instruction-fixing element of the /improve-system pipeline. The loop that builds the loop.

---

## Problem Statement

The /improve-system pipeline works end-to-end: observations accumulate on position epics, cluster into release epics, get diagnosed, and route to manage-artifact for the fix step. Evidence collection is strong. Evidence-to-fix conversion is the weak link.

The contract strategy (Part 6: "The System Gets Smarter") sells the improvement loop as the client-facing differentiator — every time someone uses the system, the system improves. manage-artifact is the mechanism that makes this promise real. If it's unreliable, the competitive moat is hollow.

After 5+ passes on CCI #604 Theme 1 (JA /probe auto-advance), the behavior persists. The current manage-artifact skill (created December 12, 2025) is bloated, unfocused, and built on methodology that predates Claude 4.6's behavioral changes.

**Three likely root causes (hypotheses — not yet confirmed):**

1. **Bloated skill, lost methodology.** The routing table covers 6 artifact types with 8 reference files. The methodology is sound but buried in noise. No clear process a stranger could follow.

2. **Outdated assumptions.** The ADRs (001, 002) derive from the September 2024 Anthropic Deep Dive video. Claude 4.6 models overtrigger on aggressive instruction language ("CRITICAL: You MUST...", "No exceptions") — causing overeagerness, not obedience.

3. **Wrong framing.** manage-artifact treats instruction fixing as prompt engineering (static prompt → response). The actual problem is agentic instruction design — writing instructions that hold across many autonomous multi-turn sessions with tool use. Different physics.

**Preconditions:**
- The /improve-system architecture (A/B/C sessions) is validated and working
- The observation system (position epics, release epics) is mature
- The Developer position works nearly perfectly — proof the methodology CAN work
- CCI #604 provides 47 comments of empirical evidence on fix iteration failures
- These root causes are assumptions informed by empirical patterns, not confirmed diagnoses

---

## Success Definition

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | A focused skill that handles the HOW of instruction fixing — so the user can concentrate on diagnosing the behavioral problem, not on figuring out fix methodology |
| **Success** | Each fix attempt is focused and minimal. Best practices are built in from day one — the skill guides the process rather than the user directing it. Changes are small enough to attribute outcomes (did this specific change help or not?). |
| **Done test** | Can I diagnose a behavior problem and let manage-artifact guide me through a focused fix attempt without having to remind it of best practices? If YES → skill works |

---

## Approach

### Part 1: Methodology Foundation Refresh

The original manage-artifact was built on three sources:
- [Prompting 101 | Code w/ Claude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPbXH0LpIE) (~Aug 2025): prompt engineering principles, iterative development, 10-component template, 4-stage progression
- [ADR 001: Universal Prompt Engineering Principles](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/global/universal-prompt-engineering-principles)
- [ADR 002: Iterative Prompt Development Methodology](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/global/iterative-prompt-development-methodology)
- **Meincke et al. 2025**: persuasion principles (Authority, Commitment, Social Proof)

Since December 2025, Anthropic has published updated guidance that may invalidate assumptions in the current methodology. Best practices may also shift with each model generation — what works for Claude 4.6 may behave differently on the next generation. The methodology needs to be model-aware, not model-locked.

The following sources need to be consumed and cross-referenced against the existing ADRs before defining the v2 methodology. Each resource was scored on two axes by dedicated analysis agents:

- **P** = Instruction Persistence (how well it addresses instructions holding across autonomous multi-turn sessions)
- **E** = Evidence-to-Fix (how well it addresses systematic diagnosis and minimal instruction fixes)

Tier placement = combined score. Resources within a tier are ordered by combined relevance.

### Methodology Foundation Findings (Pass 3)

Tier 1 sources consumed and cross-referenced against existing methodology. Five high-leverage techniques identified for shaping AI thinking through instructions:

| # | Technique | Source | Mechanism |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Persona selection | [Anthropic PSM](https://www.anthropic.com/research/persona-selection-model) ([deep dive](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/psm/)) | Identity framing selects holistic persona from pretraining space — not compliance |
| 2 | WHY over WHAT | [Best Practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices) + [Codified Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20478) | Explanations create generalizable heuristics. Rules only cover anticipated cases |
| 3 | Thinking is promptable | [Adaptive Thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) | Native interleaved thinking shaped through system prompt — guide WHAT to think about |
| 4 | Right altitude | [Context Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) | Not too prescriptive (brittle), not too vague (no signal) |
| 5 | Consequences not commands | [ContextCov](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.00822) + Dev protocol | "X causes Y" gives thinking layer reasoning material |

**Persuasion principles (Meincke et al.): Deprecated for Claude 4.6.** Authority ("YOU MUST"), Commitment, Social Proof cause overtriggering on Claude 4.6. Strong language necessary for pre-4.6 models now produces overeagerness. Unity (shared identity) still aligns with persona selection. The calibration flipped — dial back, don't amplify.

**Model-generation note:** These findings are calibrated for Claude 4.6. Strong language effects may differ on future model generations. The methodology should be model-aware, not model-locked.

### Methodology Foundation Findings (Pass 4)

**The Two-Bible Model.** Instruction artifacts require two distinct reference frameworks depending on which dimension is being fixed:

| Bible | Scope | Artifact Types | Persistence Mechanism |
|-------|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| [PSM](https://www.anthropic.com/research/persona-selection-model) (Behavioral) | How the AI thinks — persona, beliefs, psychology | Protocol (CLAUDE.md) | Beliefs enter native thinking, create self-debate under pressure |
| [Skills Guide](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf) (Mechanical) | How to write instructions — structure, patterns, triggers | Skills/Commands (merged by Anthropic) | Progressive disclosure, validation gates, explicit step ordering, specificity |

**Evidence for separation:** The ARCHIBUS Setup agent (#629 witness observation, session e1a2095a) was written with mechanical patterns only (procedural steps, detection gates, checklists) and no PSM persona. Result: technically functional but template-following behavior — "Step 0 ✅" with checkmarks instead of the prescribed "senior CAFM colleague" behavior. Mechanical without behavioral = template agents.

**Evidence for combination needed:** The CCI #604 auto-advance required a PSM fix (belief transformation, session 97b6ea37) after 5 mechanical fix passes failed. Conversely, a PSM-informed protocol still needs mechanical structure for workflow steps. Neither Bible alone is sufficient.

**Command/Skill merger (Anthropic, 2026):** Official docs state: "Custom commands have been merged into skills." The `.claude/commands/` folder remains backward-compatible but skills are the recommended format. The [orchestration pattern](https://github.com/shanraisshan/claude-code-best-practice/blob/main/orchestration-workflow/orchestration-workflow.md) (Command → Agent → Skill) shows role separation persists in practice, but the writing format is unified. The Skills Guide PDF covers how to write both.

### Part 2: Artifact Type Physics

With Claude Code, there are four artifact types that govern agent behavior, each with a different enforcement mechanism:

| Type | Enforcement | Failure Mode |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Skill** (includes commands) | Direct invocation (`/name`) or trigger matching (AI discovers) | Instruction ignored mid-execution, doesn't fire, or fires wrong |
| **Protocol** | Persistent context (CLAUDE.md) | Decays over long sessions |
| **Hook** | Automatic (code enforcement) | Config error — but no compliance needed |

Hooks always work because they bypass instruction compliance entirely. Skills and protocols are the fragile types — they need the AI to keep following rules across many autonomous turns. The fix methodology should account for which type is being fixed, because the failure modes and fix approaches differ.

**Format merger note (Pass 4):** Anthropic's official docs state "Custom commands have been merged into skills." Both use the same SKILL.md format and YAML frontmatter. The `.claude/commands/` folder is backward-compatible. The dimensional distinction (Doing vs Knowing) still holds — a skill handling workflow steps serves a different behavioral function than a skill providing domain knowledge — but the engineering format is unified. The [Skills Guide PDF](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf) covers how to write both.

The first diagnostic question in any fix session should be: **is this behavior best addressed through instructions (command/skill/protocol) or enforcement (hook)?** Some behaviors may be structurally unfixable through instructions alone.

### The Three Dimensions of Instruction Artifacts

Beyond enforcement mechanism, each instruction-based artifact type governs a different dimension of AI behavior. This dimensional mapping is the foundation for evidence-to-fix routing (Part 3).

| Artifact Type | Dimension | Governs | Fix when... |
|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Protocol** | Thinking | Beliefs, mental models, hidden reasoning | AI reasons toward the wrong action |
| **Skill (Doing)** | Doing | Steps, gates, workflow lifecycle | AI skips a step or takes a shortcut |
| **Skill (Knowing)** | Knowing | Domain knowledge, experience, reference | AI lacks knowledge to do its job |
| **Hook** | Enforcement | Structural guarantees | Instructions can't reliably ensure compliance |

**The principle: "When we get thinking right, we get behavior right."** The AI's decisions happen in the hidden thinking trace (native thinking, sequential thinking, interleaved reasoning) before visible output. Protocol shapes this layer. Commands shape what the AI does after thinking. Skills provide what the AI needs to know. When thinking is correct, doing follows naturally. **When thinking is wrong, no amount of procedural instruction overrides it.**

**Evidence:** CCI #604 Theme 1 — five procedural fix passes targeting the /probe command failed to resolve JA auto-advance behavior. Conversation-reader analysis of two Session C conversations (9f14b021, 5459d299) revealed the AI's thinking trace explicitly reasoned: "This is resolved. Let me move to the next item." The belief ("user answered = item done") overrode the procedural instruction ("don't advance"). The fix needed to target protocol (thinking), not command (doing).

**Architectural implication:** The Developer protocol is pure thinking-layer — behavioral principles only, procedural detail lives in commands. [The JA protocol](https://github.com/veloxforce/claude-user-configs/blob/45d27f3/personas/ja/CLAUDE.md) mixes thinking and doing — procedural rules embedded alongside behavioral principles. This mixing gives JA fixes higher blast radius: every fix touches the core protocol, potentially destabilizing other behaviors. Separating these layers is a prerequisite for reliable instruction fixes.

The /probe auto-advance (CCI #604) was initially hypothesized as potentially unfixable through instructions. Dimensional analysis (above) revealed it as a thinking-layer problem misdiagnosed as a doing-layer problem — procedural fixes targeted the wrong dimension. Whether a hook is still needed remains open after attempting a protocol-level (thinking) fix.

The mechanical precedence between instruction layers IS specified by Anthropic: settings follow Managed → CLI → Local → Shared → User; CLAUDE.md loads with project > user precedence; skill name collisions resolve enterprise > personal > project. Output styles modify the system prompt directly while CLAUDE.md arrives as a user message after it ([source](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/output-styles#output-styles-vs-claude-md-vs-append-system-prompt)).

**Undefined:** What remains unspecified is **behavioral conflict resolution at runtime** — when a CLAUDE.md protocol and a skill's instructions give contradictory behavioral guidance, Anthropic's docs explicitly state: "Claude may pick one arbitrarily" ([source](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory#choose-where-to-put-claude-md-files)). This matters for diagnosing fix failures — the fix might be correct but overridden by a competing instruction in a different layer. The "pick arbitrarily" admission confirms this is intentionally unspecified, not undiscovered documentation.

To decide which artifact type is the right fix, the methodology needs a mapping from failure domain to artifact type. Initial framing:

| Artifact Type | What It Fixes | Example |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Command** | Doing — the AI doesn't follow the right steps when the user triggers a specific process | /capture gate loop, /probe question format |
| **Skill** | Knowing — the AI doesn't know HOW to build a specific kind of artifact | Prepackaged thinking for design docs, meeting agendas |
| **Protocol** | Thinking — the AI believes the wrong thing regardless of context or which command is running | Output formatting, git conventions, investigation delegation |
| **Hook** | Enforcement — instruction-based compliance isn't reliable enough, need a structural guarantee | Blocking tool calls without prerequisites, auto-formatting |

**Related:** [ADR-008: Distinguish Workflows, Protocols, and Agents](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/global/distinguish-workflows-protocols-agents-ai-systems) defines the architectural hierarchy (Protocol → Agent → Workflow). This ADR predates the artifact type routing table but establishes the conceptual framework for why different artifact types exist and what layer they operate at.

### The Thinking Mechanism (Pass 3)

Native interleaved thinking — the reasoning that fires automatically between every tool call — is where behavioral decisions happen. Confirmed by Anthropic's docs ("Adaptive thinking automatically enables interleaved thinking") and interpretability research (visible thinking ≠ internal computation, but scaffolding influences outcomes).

**Three channels, one primary:**

| Channel | Mechanism | Behavioral governance? |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| Native interleaved | Always fires, can't be skipped | **Primary** — decisions happen here |
| Sequential thinking (MCP) | Requires invocation (doing-layer decision) | No — native thinking can override |
| AoT (MCP) | Requires invocation (doing-layer decision) | No — native thinking can override |

MCP thinking tools add visible reasoning text, but native thinking makes the actual behavioral decision after processing their output. For behavioral governance, protocol instructions target native thinking. MCP thinking tools remain useful for analytical depth in commands/skills.

**How instructions shape native thinking:**

Instructions don't control the internal computation directly — they shape the context that native thinking operates on. The mechanism: protocol instruction → shapes context → native thinking processes context → decision. Effective when instructions create beliefs (reasoning material). Ineffective when instructions create rules (compliance targets).

### Empirical Validation: Principles vs Rules (Pass 3)

Dev session analysis (34d514fe, #1056 implementation) vs JA Session C conversations (9f14b021, 5459d299):

**Dev protocol — belief holds under pressure:**

User says "download it please." The AI's thinking trace:

> 1. *"But wait — I'm in requirements-clarity phase, investigation only, no writes."*
> 2. *"Actually, downloading a test fixture file isn't implementation..."*
> 3. *"But to be safe, I'll note it as a requirement and handle it in implementation."*
> 4. *"Actually the user said 'download it please' — that's a direct instruction. But I'm in requirements-clarity where I CAN'T create/write files."*

Four rounds of self-debate. Direct user instruction loses to internalized belief. No rule cited — the protocol created a belief, not a compliance pattern. 83% of 18 thinking blocks showed this belief-based reasoning.

**JA protocol — rule reinterpreted under pressure:**

Thinking trace at the failure moment (Session C1):

> *"I think S1 is resolved. Let me move to S2."*

One line. No debate. No self-argument. When caught and asked to introspect (Session C2):

> *"The source of this behavior: I think I'm pattern-matching on 'the user answered the question = item is done.'"*

The rule "user clicks Next" didn't enter the thinking trace — it was absent, not overridden. A belief ("only the user determines completion") would have competed. A rule ("don't advance without Next") didn't.

**The contrast:** Beliefs create internal arguments that persist under pressure. Rules create compliance targets that fold under pattern-matching.

The JA protocol's bones are there (identity, some WHY, authority model). The fix is separation: extract procedures into commands, strengthen the principles that are partially present.

**Undefined:** Artifact type sub-categories and edge cases. What belongs in a command vs. a protocol when the behavior spans multiple commands? What belongs in a skill vs. a command when the process is interactive AND produces an artifact? Need empirical validation from existing artifacts that work well (Developer position) vs. ones that don't (CCI #604). Cross-reference with ADR-008's architectural hierarchy.

### Part 3: The Evidence-to-Fix Methodology

Current workflow: rubber-duck → clarity phases → micro-iteration → test. The first diagnostic step is now validated. Remaining questions are hypotheses that need cross-referencing against Tier 1 sources.

### Step 1: Dimensional Diagnosis (Hypothesis with empirical evidence)

**The question:** "Is this a thinking problem, a doing problem, or a knowing problem?"

**Method:** Use conversation-reader to extract the thinking trace from the failure moment in the Session C conversation. Read the AI's hidden reasoning (native thinking, sequential thinking, interleaved thinking) immediately before the failure.

**Classification signals:**

| Signal | Thinking (Protocol) | Doing (Command) | Knowing (Skill) |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Thinking trace | AI reasoned TOWARD wrong action | No reasoning — just skipped | AI searched but couldn't find |
| Fix persistence | Procedural fixes don't stick | Procedural fix works immediately | Adding reference resolves it |
| In-session correction | Adjusts after told WHY | Adjusts after shown WHAT | Adjusts after given knowledge |

**Validated against:** Two Session C conversations from CCI #604 (9f14b021, 5459d299). Both showed the AI reasoning "this is resolved, let me move on" in the thinking trace — a thinking problem misdiagnosed as a doing problem for 5 fix passes.

### Step 2+: Remaining Diagnostic Questions (Hypotheses)

- Which artifact type should fix this? (→ Part 2 dimensional mapping)
- Is this an instruction problem, a tool contract problem, or a model capability ceiling?
- If instruction: is it phrasing, placement, or structural?
- How minimal can the change be while still being attributable in Session C?
- Is the current [prompt template](https://github.com/veloxforce/claude-user-configs/blob/main/templates/anthropic-prompt-template.md) (10-component Anthropic structure) still the right framework, or does it need updating for Claude 4.6 and agentic contexts?

**Undefined:** The evaluator-optimizer pattern from Anthropic's cookbooks (separate evaluator with binary verdict + structured feedback + memory of prior attempts) could formalize the verification step. Needs investigation after consuming Tier 1 sources.

**Partially resolved:** Zack Witten's self-diagnosis technique ("ask the model why it got it wrong and ask it to rewrite the instructions"). Empirically validated: JA AI self-diagnosed in Session C2 — *"I'm pattern-matching on 'user answered = item done.'"* The AI can identify its own failure mode when prompted to introspect. Formalizing self-diagnosis as a diagnostic step is supported by evidence. **Undefined:** Should this be Step 2 in the methodology, and what's the prompt format?

**Undefined:** The "error cascade" finding (Where LLM Agents Fail, arxiv:2509.25370) — errors cascade across steps, which explains why single-instruction patches fail. How to formalize root cause attribution in the diagnosis phase?

### Part 4: Structural Patterns for Instruction Persistence

Patterns surfaced from Anthropic's engineering blog and academic research. These were convergence findings from Passes 1-3, predating the [Skills Guide PDF](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf) (Pass 4). The Skills Guide carries more authority for skill-building patterns — its 5 workflow patterns (sequential orchestration, multi-MCP coordination, iterative refinement, context-aware tool selection, domain-specific intelligence) are Anthropic's consolidated guidance. The patterns below remain valid for persistence-specific concerns (state survival across context windows) but need re-evaluation against the Skills Guide where they overlap:

| Pattern | What It Does | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| JSON state files | Resist inappropriate overwriting better than markdown | Effective Harnesses |
| Progress files as external memory | State survives context window refreshes | Effective Harnesses |
| Initializer agent with different prompt | First context window (setup) vs. subsequent (iteration) | Effective Harnesses |
| Targeted strong language | Reserve authority phrasing for true safety boundaries only ("unacceptable to remove tests"). **Claude 4.6 update:** blanket "YOU MUST" / "No exceptions" causes overtriggering — surgical deployment only | Effective Harnesses |
| XML tags as instruction anchors | Named behavioral rules (`<default_to_action>`) | Prompting Best Practices |
| Context continuation prompt | Tell Claude that compaction is happening | Prompting Best Practices |
| Git as state tracking | Claude 4.6 excels at discovering state from filesystem | Prompting Best Practices |
| Constitution (always-loaded doc) | Persistent conventions + orchestration protocols | Codified Context paper |

**Undefined:** Which patterns should manage-artifact v2 recommend by default? The new version should prescribe specific structural patterns per artifact type (Part 2), not treat all artifacts the same.

**Partially resolved:** The "Codified Context" paper documents a three-component architecture. Mapping to our architecture:

| Codified Context | Our Architecture | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Constitution (always loaded, ~660 lines) | CLAUDE.md (protocol) | Always in attention window. Governs thinking. |
| Specialized agents | Commands + Skills | Invoked on demand. Governs doing + knowing. |
| Cold-memory knowledge base | Hippocampus | Cross-project knowledge retrieval. |

**Undefined:** The paper's governing constraint is conciseness (~660 lines). Our CLAUDE.md files are longer. Does length impact thinking-layer effectiveness? Need empirical measurement.
