# Developer Position Beta — Plugin Scope & Delivery
[[traceline]]

Design decisions for shipping the Developer Position as a beta product. Scope: what goes in the plugin, how users interact, and architectural choices.

---

## Problem Statement

The Developer Operations Manual defines a complete workflow (Path A: Spec-Design, Path B: Spec-Implement with Implementation + Verification sessions). This workflow is implemented as Claude Code skills and commands built over months of internal use. Shipping it to 10 beta users requires determining which components are load-bearing for the experience versus personal customization, and how to package them without exposing internal infrastructure (GitHub as backend, tracking repos, context trickle automation).

**Preconditions:**
- Developer Operations Manual v3 exists and defines the target experience
- Plugin delivery is the only viable distribution method (Claude Code plugin system)
- GitHub Issues is the persistence layer (beta decision, not permanent)
- Beta audience is ~10 developers, not general public
- Claude Code's native plan mode conflicts with the system's own planning workflow

---

## Success Definition

- **Goal:** A beta user installs the plugin and completes Path A (spec-design) + Path B (spec-implement + verify) on their own project without Marius explaining infrastructure
- **Success:** Beta users run the workflow independently; friction points surface through flag-for-improvement, not through confusion
- **Done test:** Christoph builds and completes the tutorial without asking Marius for clarification → plugin is ready for first 1-2 users
- **Rollout cadence:** 2 users first (David Eberle, Dylan Brodeur) → 2-3 day observation → expand to 10. Purpose of the first 2: surface distribution quirks (GitHub setup, onboarding, packaging) with close contacts who give direct feedback. Expansion criterion: distribution quirks resolved (Marius judgment — the system is proven internally, distribution is the new variable). One-off seeding pattern.
- **Launch target:** Monday 2026-02-23

## Approach

### Part 1: Plugin File Inventory

The Developer Operations Manual is the inclusion filter. Every file that maps to a manual step is load-bearing; everything else is cut.

**Shared (all sessions):**

| Component | Type | Beta Status |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `/onboarding` | Command | Ship (simplified) |
| `/issue-comment` | Command | Ship as-is |
| `/feedback` | Command | Ship (renamed from /flag-for-improvement, modified routing) |
| `deliverable-tracking` | Skill | Ship as-is |

**Path A: Spec-Design**

| Component | Type | Required? | Beta Status |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `/rubber-duck` | Command | Required | Ship as-is |
| `ac-create` | Skill | Required | Ship (both Scout phases, Skip option) |

**Path B — Implementation Session:**

| Component | Type | Required? | Beta Status |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `/rubber-duck` | Command | Optional | Ship as-is |
| `/requirements-clarity` | Command | Required | Ship (remove discovery script) |
| `/implementation-clarity` | Command | Required | Ship (keep discovery script — worktree) |
| `/evaluation-clarity` | Command | Required | Ship (remove discovery script) |
| `worktree` | Skill | Optional | Ship (ask in implementation-clarity) |

**Path B — Verification Session:**

| Component | Type | Required? | Beta Status |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `/rubber-duck` | Command | Optional | Ship as-is |
| `/ac-verify` | Command | Required | Ship as-is |
| `/merge` | Command | Required | Ship as-is |

**Cut for beta:**
- Document templates (backend/frontend README fetch)
- Quick investigation mode in onboarding (keep Full + Skip only)
- Auto-forward between clarity stages
- Discovery script in requirements-clarity and evaluation-clarity
- Transcript agent, email agent, design doc link agent (context trickle)
- Hippocampus knowledge management
- Shutdown ritual, create-contract, emyth, create-pflichtenheft

### Part 2: Onboarding Simplification

Beta onboarding keeps: session context bootstrap (repo + project only), protocol understanding (sequential thinking), brief introduction, issue selection from GitHub, investigation agent.

**Investigation:** Ask with time estimate (~60s). Options: Full / Skip. Quick mode removed.

**Cut:** detected label validation, SSH hosts, GH extensions, CLIs, document template selection, collaborator display. Bootstrap reduced to: which repo, which project, which issues exist.

### Part 3: Confidence & Handoff Loop

**Rubber-duck confidence signal** lives in the skill itself (line 61, lines 67-71). Four exit options: Quick fix, Let's plan, Define ACs, Keep thinking. Ships as-is.

**AC Create Scout:** Both phases (Scout Agent + Investigator Agent) ship with existing Skip option. Beta feedback determines whether to cut later.

**AC Create Refinement Gate:** All 4 checks stay (Observable Output, Test Data, Design Questions, Blocking Dependencies).

### Part 4: Clarity Workflow

Three phases ship. No auto-forward — user drives timing.

Discovery script kept in `/implementation-clarity` only (worktree). Removed from `/requirements-clarity` (hook enforces deliverable-tracking) and `/evaluation-clarity` (discovers nothing).

### Part 5: Execute & Task Complete

**Worktree:** Optional. Asked in implementation-clarity. No worktree = no branch enforcement, no draft PR. User's responsibility.

**Task Complete protocol** extended:
1. Push to remote (evidence checkpoint)
2. Show commit hash link + issue link
3. AI proposes next step based on session work
4. AskUserQuestion — "Post as issue comment? Yes / No"
5. If yes → `/issue-comment` with proposed next step

**DoD update:** Task Complete updates DoD checkboxes after execution. Verified working — ships as-is.

### Part 6: GitHub Integration & Repo Architecture

**Principle:** The system works towards the user's tools, not ours. GitHub is the first adapter — architecture is task-manager-agnostic. Target systems need an API, HTTP endpoint, or CLI to integrate. Three-phase progression:
1. **Beta:** Shared plugin repo (our infrastructure). Users interact with GitHub Issues directly.
2. **Next:** Per-user GitHub repos (user-owned infrastructure).
3. **Future:** Any task manager via adapters (GitHub, Linear, Jira, etc.).

**Issue-commit-linker:** Ships for beta. Same-repo = GITHUB_TOKEN sufficient.

**Spec reading:** Local markdown files (tracking.md). GitHub Pages deferred.

**Repo model (resolved):** Single shared repo for beta. Per-user forks rejected as unnecessary complexity for 10 trusted users. Issue visibility is a known tradeoff: all beta users see all issues (including `/feedback` submissions). All 10 beta users are hand-picked, reducing IP risk. Per-user repos (phase 2) are a gating requirement for any IP-sensitive client — enterprise adoption is blocked until visibility isolation exists.

**Beta disclosure requirements:** Two disclosures before user starts:
1. Shared visibility — "Your issues are visible to all beta participants."
2. Conversation data — sessions are collected and feed system improvement (compounding knowledge mechanism).

**Undefined: Data collection & business model** — Conversation data is the improvement fuel. Monetization differential: subscription to curated best practices (system improves via collected data) vs. self-serve (user keeps data private). Legal mechanism for data collection consent undefined. → See Meeting Agenda

### Part 7: Feedback (Beta)

Command renamed from `/flag-for-improvement` to `/feedback` — discoverability for beta users ("feedback" is immediately understood, "flag for improvement" is meta-language). Same behavior, same routing.

Routes to CCI directly via GitHub Action workflow dispatch in plugin repo. PAT stored as repo secret. `github.actor` captures username. **Visibility boundary:** beta users see a thank-you confirmation on submission but do not see the CCI board or how feedback is triaged. GitHub App (Traceline Bot) deferred until user-facing visibility exists.

**Community layer:** Discord channel for async communication — escape valve for when `/feedback` itself fails or for high-level overall impressions. Structure owned by Christoph.

**Undefined: Feedback resolution notification** — Should users be notified when their feedback is resolved? → See Meeting Agenda

### Part 8: Plan Mode Prevention

Claude Code's native plan mode (read-only, triggered via Shift+Tab or EnterPlanMode tool) conflicts with the system's clarity workflow. Three layers prevent accidental activation:

| Layer | Mechanism | Scope |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Plugin `hooks.json` | PreToolUse deny on `EnterPlanMode` | Blocks AI from entering plan mode |
| Setup script | `permissions.defaultMode: "default"` in settings.json | Session starts in normal mode |
| Plugin `CLAUDE.md` | "Use clarity workflow, not native plan mode" | Instruction reinforcement |

User-side gap: Shift+Tab still cycles through plan mode (no technical block available). README documents: "stay in normal or auto-accept mode."

### Part 9: MCP & Tool Inventory

Four MCP servers ship bundled in the plugin via `.mcp.json`. All are universal — every user benefits regardless of stack.

| MCP | Purpose | Used By |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Sequential Thinking | Structured reasoning | Cross-cutting (onboarding, rubber-duck, clarity) |
| Chrome DevTools | UI verification | AC Verify (UI layer) |
| Context7 | Library documentation lookup | Cross-cutting |
| Read Website Fast | Web content access | Cross-cutting |

**Cut:** Fireflies (personal infrastructure), Supabase (personal database).

**AC Verify routing** determines which tool verifies each acceptance criterion:

| Verification Layer | Tool | Ships With Plugin? |
|-------------------|------|--------------------|
| UI | Chrome DevTools MCP | Yes |
| API | curl / bash | Yes (built-in) |
| Database | User's database MCP | No — stack-dependent |

Database verification is the only stack-dependent element. README provides guidance: "AC Verify routes database checks through your database MCP" with links to MongoDB, Postgres, Supabase, and MySQL MCP servers. Users configure their own.

**Delivery:** MCPs bundled directly in the plugin (not via meta-MCP layer). Experimental MCP CLI flag stays enabled — removal untested.

### Part 10: Settings & Environment Configuration

The plugin delivery splits between what the plugin handles natively and what a setup script configures.

**Plugin native (no user action):**

| Component | Plugin File | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Hooks | `hooks.json` | PreToolUse deny on EnterPlanMode |
| MCP servers | `.mcp.json` | 4 bundled MCPs |
| LSP config | `.lsp.json` | Language server connections (TypeScript, Python) |
| Skills | `skills/` | Workflow skills (ac-create, worktree, etc.) |
| Commands | `commands/` | Onboarding, clarity phases, etc. |
| Instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | Protocol, workflow rules |

**Setup script (runs once at install):**

The script handles three categories: settings, protocol, and dependencies.

*Settings:* Writes `settings.json` with `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY`, `permissions.defaultMode`, empty allow-list.

*Protocol:* Copies the CLAUDE.md protocol to the user's project. The plugin bundles CLAUDE.md for plugin-level instructions, but the setup script ensures the project-level protocol is in place.

*Dependencies:*

| Dependency | Install Method | Required For |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Claude Code (pinned version) | `claude update` or native installer | Core runtime |
| LSP binaries | `npm install -g typescript-language-server` | Back pressure loop (diagnostics) |
| LSP plugins | `claude plugin install typescript-lsp@...` | LSP configuration |
| gh (GitHub CLI) | `brew install gh` / system package | Issue integration, commit linker |
| uv | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh` | Bootstrap scripts |
| GTA (opt-in) | Install if user enables worktrees | Git worktree automation |
| Chrome DevTools | MCP server binary | UI verification in AC Verify |

Draft inventory — validated with Christoph during tutorial building.

**Onboarding wizard (resolved):** Three-stage flow from "I'm in" to first real session:
1. **Entry:** `curl https://traceline.dev/install | bash` (or equivalent hosted URL)
2. **Setup script:** Minimal prereq check (Claude Code installed?), then walks through what's being installed — transparency and consent before action. Installs plugin + dependencies from the table above.
3. **Tutorial:** Opens `--sdk-url` scripted walkthrough in browser — guides Path A (spec-design) and Path B (spec-implement) using a fake issue.

Beta-level checks only — things change fast, don't over-engineer the install script.

**Idea (future):** `--sdk-url` could script the ENTIRE wizard (install + tutorial as one WebSocket-driven flow). Requires Christoph discussion.

**Release pipeline:** Alpha (Marius daily use) → `release-plugin` skill → beta distribution plugin repo (TBD — not the internal Claude Team Marketplace). `clarity-workflow-plugin` repo archived.

**Undefined: Beta distribution repo** — The internal Claude Team Marketplace (`MariusWilsch/claude-code-team-marketplace`) is for internal use only. A separate repo is needed for beta user distribution. → See Meeting Agenda

**Undefined: Client-side verification** — AI behavior is validated internally by using the system's own workflow (clarity phases, AC verify, DoD tracking) on real work — not by a separate test suite. The open question is: how do we verify the plugin works correctly on the client's machine after install/update? Alpha testing happens on Marius's environment — differences in client setup could surface issues. → See Meeting Agenda

*Settings shipped:*

| Setting | Delivery | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Disable auto memory | `env` key in settings.json | Auto memory conflicts with protocol-driven workflow |
| Default permission mode | `permissions.defaultMode` | Session starts in normal mode, not plan mode |
| Allow-list | Empty (not pre-configured) | Users configure their own permissions |
| Auto-forward | Not shipped | Users should observe output before auto-approving |

**LSP:** Plugin configures language server connections via `.lsp.json`. Setup script installs binaries. LSP creates a back pressure loop: AI edits → language server catches errors instantly → AI fixes in the same turn. No compiler run needed.

**Version pinning:** Minimum version 2.1.32 (first to support Opus 4.6). Exact version pinned at launch after stability testing. Version pinning is a value proposition: "We test and determine the most stable version with the best prompt and feature compatibility."

### Part 11: Tutorial & README

**Tutorial:** The `--sdk-url` flag turns the Claude Code terminal into a WebSocket connection, powering a scripted walkthrough. The AI guides the user through Path A (spec-design) and Path B (spec-implement) using a fake issue. Dual purpose: Christoph learns the system while building the onboarding artifact. Litmus test: if Path B can't be scripted with a fake issue, the system isn't self-explanatory.

The tutorial is stage 3 of the onboarding wizard (see Part 10). Users arrive here after the install script has configured their environment. The tutorial is not standalone — it's the guided first experience after setup.

**Owner:** Christoph. "Lass mich erstmal das Tutorial bauen."

**README structure:**
1. **Vision** — what way of thinking we're selling (long-term, not product description — "it's a beta, describing it as a product would be stupid")
2. **Setup** — how to install and get running (setup script output)

**Undefined: Positioning language** — The concept is now articulated: "AI doesn't need more tech people. It needs organizational people." The system treats AI like an employee — position agreements, training (operations manual), standards, accountability. Developer position makes AI-assisted development deterministic (Issues → Code). Broader Traceline: any business function → consistent output via organizational standards. Problem frame: "rogue developer → organizational standards." The NAME is undefined ("Traceline" has reservations, no alternative locked). → See Meeting Agenda
