# DS-Kit Navigation — Production Readiness Design
[[client-iitr]]

Rebuilding the DS-Kit Navigation system from scratch using PageIndex (vectorless, tree-based retrieval) to deliver production-ready accuracy on IITR's on-premise infrastructure.

---

## Problem Statement

IITR's DS-Kit product serves ~3,500 customers who regularly contact support with recurring questions (27-28/day per Stellmacher). A navigation system reduces this support load by answering common questions automatically.

A previous prototype (Typesense + chunked RAG) scored 17/29 on the test harness. The chunking approach proved fragile — correct answers existed in the data but vector similarity retrieved wrong chunks. That implementation is being retired.

This project rebuilds the navigation system using PageIndex — a vectorless, tree-based retrieval framework that eliminates chunking entirely. The LLM reasons through a document tree index to find relevant sections, producing traceable, chapter-referenced answers.

**Preconditions:**
- Design artifacts from prior attempt preserved: Pflichtenheft, test questions with source references (29 Q&A + Quelle column), Masterfragen CSV (22 entries), Anwenderleitfaden PDF, 56 DS-Kit templates
- PageIndex benchmarked on IITR-STAGING: Qwen 3.5 9B with think:false achieves ~0.76s per tree traversal call, ~8.5s for full 5-call + answer pipeline (RTX 4000 SFF Ada, 20 GB VRAM)
- Financial reset: prior work uninvoiced, Roman terminated, clean start
- Developer: Dave implements from this design doc, Marius orchestrates as JA

## Success Definition

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | Navigation system is production-ready: accurate answers with chapter-referenced navigation on the 29-question test set |
| **Success** | Test harness scores ≥26/29 (>90%) using PageIndex retrieval. Answers include chapter reference from tree traversal path. Stellmacher/Kraska validate answer quality via sample review. |
| **Done test** | "Can I write a meeting agenda with open design questions?" → If NO → design is complete |

**Test harness mechanism:** Sends each question through PageIndex tree traversal (Qwen 3.5, think:false) to retrieve relevant sections, then generates answer from retrieved context. An LLM judge evaluates each answer across four dimensions (content accuracy, format, chapter reference, source traceability) defined in the Test Rubric section. PASS/FAIL per question with German-language reasoning.

---

## Infrastructure Baseline

IITR-STAGING hosts the target deployment. A server audit (2026-03-09) found 11 Docker stacks running ~70 containers — far more than previously documented. This includes orphaned experiments, crash-looping services, and three overlapping observability stacks. Cleanup is a prerequisite for deploying the new PageIndex stack.

**Retire (cleanup first):**

| Stack | Why | Compose File |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| IITR-RAG-V2 (Typesense, OpenWebUI :3006, Pipelines) | Replaced by PageIndex | `/home/shared/projects/IITR-RAG-V2/docker-compose.yml` |
| DS-Kit clone (all stopped) | Duplicate of RAG-V2 | `/opt/dskit-rag/docker-compose.yml` |
| Chunkr (~47 containers, crash-looping) | Dependencies stopped 5 months ago, burning CPU | `/home/shared/projects/IITR-RAG-V2/services/chunkr/compose.yaml` |
| RAG-Dev (OpenWebUI :3001, Ollama, Qdrant) | Dev environment, not needed | `/home/shared/projects/IITR-RAG-V1/docker-compose.dev.yml` |
| Langfuse-POC (orphaned, compose file deleted) | Experiment containers still running | Compose deleted — stop manually |
| SigNoz (APM, ClickHouse, Zookeeper) | Consolidating to Langfuse only | `/home/shared/projects/signoz/deploy/docker/docker-compose.yaml` |
| OpenLIT (LLM observability, ClickHouse) | Overlaps with Langfuse | `/home/shared/projects/openlit/docker-compose.yml` |
| Trieve (orphaned volumes only) | No containers, 7 dangling volumes | Volumes only — `docker volume rm` |

After container removal: `docker system prune` to reclaim ~690 GB (unused images, volumes, build cache). All old data (Typesense indexes, Qdrant vectors, Chunkr parsed docs) is disposable — PageIndex replaces all prior retrieval approaches. No external IITR systems depend on this staging server.

**Production stack (after cleanup):**

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 4000 SFF Ada, 20 GB VRAM |
| Ollama | v0.17.7 in Docker (`rag-staging-ollama`, port 11436) |
| Qwen 3.5 9B | Pulled, benchmarked — 0.76s/call with think:false |
| Qwen 3.5 4B | Pulled, benchmarked — 0.67s/call with think:false |
| OpenWebUI | Port 3002 — IITR Keycloak SSO + OTEL configured (`rag-staging-openwebui`) |
| Langfuse | Port 3003 — LLM tracing (web, worker, ClickHouse, Postgres, Redis, MinIO) |
| MetaMCP | Port 12008 — MCP proxy/manager |

**Access:**
- SSH: `ssh marius@IITR-STAGING`
- Ollama API: `http://localhost:11436/api/generate`
- Production compose: `/home/shared/projects/IITR-RAG-V1/docker-compose.staging.yml`
- Langfuse compose: `/home/shared/projects/langfuse/docker-compose.yml`
- MetaMCP compose: `/home/shared/projects/metamcp/docker-compose.yml`

**Cleanup sequence:** Retire all stacks in the table above → `docker system prune` → verify production stack healthy → then proceed to Approach Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup) for PageIndex deployment.

**New stack (to deploy):**
- PageIndex (open-source, MIT) — tree index generation + retrieval
- Qwen 3.5 9B via Ollama — tree traversal + answer generation + tree index generation (single model)
- OpenWebUI — chat interface (retained on port 3002, reconfigure backend from Flask proxy to PageIndex)
- Test harness — automated 29-question evaluation with LLM judge

**Validated (2026-03-09):**
- **PageIndex runs fully local** — 2 patches needed: (1) tiktoken fallback in `utils.py` (`cl100k_base` for Qwen model names), (2) `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var for Ollama routing
- **Qwen 3.5 9B single model** — produces valid structured JSON with `think:false`. Tested against Qwen 3 30B-A3B: 9B wins because `think:false` is ignored on Qwen 3, consuming all tokens on thinking. 9B also produces richer titles and summaries.
- **All 29 test questions sourced** — Navigationssystem FAQ (19/29), Anwenderleitfaden PDF (3/29), DS-Kit Oberfläche chapters (7/29). Full mapping in [epic #959 comment](https://github.com/DaveX2001/deliverable-tracking/issues/959#issuecomment-4021675769).
- **Source data organized** — [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gnxBulrnkGh-Oyly_jabofNo4SVivQhR) with INPUT/ (knowledge base) and TEST_RUBRIK/ (evaluation rubric)

## Approach

Four phases, executed sequentially. Each phase produces a testable artifact before the next begins.

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

Deploy the PageIndex + Ollama + OpenWebUI stack on IITR-STAGING. PageIndex is not currently installed — this is a from-scratch deployment.

**How PageIndex works:** PageIndex transforms documents into hierarchical JSON tree indexes (like a machine-readable table of contents with `title`, `text`, `page_index`, and nested `nodes`). At query time, the LLM receives the tree structure + user query and returns a `{thinking, node_list}` JSON identifying relevant nodes. The selected nodes' text becomes the context for answer generation. No vector database, no chunking — the LLM reasons through the document structure.

- Clone PageIndex repo, apply tiktoken fallback patch for Qwen model names
- Configure Ollama endpoint (`http://localhost:11436/v1`) as PageIndex backend
- Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + dummy API key for PageIndex → Ollama routing
- Rewrite OpenWebUI pipeline filter for PageIndex (the existing `dskit_navigation_filter.py` is Typesense-based and non-functional — `DskitRagBase` import missing). New pipeline: load tree JSON → LLM tree search via Ollama → extract node text → generate answer with chapter references
- Tree indexes stored as JSON files on disk. Multi-document loading strategy (all trees at once vs doc-level routing) depends on actual tree sizes — resolve during implementation
- Build test harness: automated 29-question evaluation against expected answers from [test set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKLPVazIDCVQtpZaR509-NbiVZbjEnmkY44raMdbM2A/edit?gid=492982273)

### 2. Data Preparation

Feed all source documents to PageIndex. PDFs go in directly (PageIndex handles PDF → tree natively). Non-PDF formats need conversion first. Ingest everything — full documents, not cherry-picked by question. Text-only extraction, no visual elements. Note: PageIndex warns that markdown converted from PDF/HTML often loses heading hierarchy — use `--pdf_path` for PDFs, reserve `--md_path` for natively structured markdown.

**Data availability (as of 2026-03-09):**
- Anwenderleitfaden PDF: on staging at `/home/shared/projects/IITR-RAG-V2/data/` and on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzSc_X3yAlv1N55CvrWRAHsqGA7m2ISJ/view)
- Masterfragen + Testfragen: on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gnxBulrnkGh-Oyly_jabofNo4SVivQhR) as Google Sheets
- Templates: TBD — download from `core.iitr.de/tenant/3520/page/82177` (Keycloak auth required) or Marius provides
- Web chapters 1-12: TBD — re-extraction needed as clean markdown (Pass 5). 7/29 test questions depend on these; first evaluation runs on available sources (22/29 questions)

| Source | Format | Conversion | PageIndex Input |
|--------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Anwenderleitfaden | PDF | None | `--pdf_path` |
| Templates (PDF subset) | PDF | None | `--pdf_path` |
| Templates (Word subset) | .docx | Convert to PDF or extract to markdown | `--pdf_path` or `--md_path` |
| Templates (Excel subset) | .xlsx | Convert to structured markdown | `--md_path` |
| Masterfragen (22 Q&A) | CSV/Excel | Convert to structured Q&A markdown | `--md_path` |
| core.iitr.de chapters 1-12 | Web | Scrape → markdown per chapter | `--md_path` |

### 3. Tree Index Generation

Run PageIndex on each prepared document to produce hierarchical tree indexes:

- `python run_pageindex.py --pdf_path <doc> --model qwen3.5:9b` (via Ollama)
- Also supports markdown: `--md_path` for pre-extracted content
- One-time operation per document — regenerate only when source content changes
- Tree indexes enable chapter-referenced answers naturally — the tree traversal path IS the chapter reference (no separate dual-answer prompting needed)

### 4. Evaluation & Iteration

Run the test harness against the 29-question set with Quelle-mapped expected answers. An existing test harness (`dskit_test_harness.py` on staging) provides reusable infrastructure: OpenWebUI API integration, LLM judge with German-language reasoning (Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter), and CORRECT/PARTIAL/INCORRECT scoring. Currently tests 14 questions — expand to the full 29-question set. The judge evaluates against expected key information per question. Iterate on:

- Retrieval prompts (tree traversal instructions)
- Answer generation prompts (format, language, detail level)
- Model selection (Qwen 3.5 4B vs 9B — 4B faster, 9B may be more accurate on edge cases)
- `think:false` confirmed for tree traversal; evaluate whether answer generation benefits from thinking

Target: ≥26/29 (>90%). Present sample answers to Stellmacher for qualitative review at bi-weekly meeting (Mar 17).

## Test Rubric

Every answer is evaluated across four dimensions by an LLM judge (Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter). The judge evaluates from the perspective of a non-specialist customer — someone who doesn't know the DS-Kit inside out and asks general questions. An answer that addresses the customer's intent is correct, even if it deviates from the pre-written expected answer.

### Evaluation Dimensions

| Dimension | What it measures | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Content Accuracy** | Does the answer help the customer solve their problem? Judged by user intent, not keyword matching. | Q5: General "yes, annual training" answer passes — it addresses the customer's actual question about whether training is included. |
| **Format** | Does the answer follow the dual-answer structure? Section 1: general answer to the question. Section 2: navigation hint pointing to where in the DS-Kit to find it (e.g., "Kapitel 11, Unterpunkt 2"). | "Ja, Sie erhalten Schulungen. Die Schulung sollte jährlich erfolgen. → Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter Kapitel 11 im Bereich eLearning." |
| **Chapter Reference** | Does the answer cite the correct DS-Kit chapter? Verified at two levels: (1) the answer text mentions the right chapter, and (2) the PageIndex tree traversal navigated to the correct document section. Skip for questions without chapter mapping (e.g., FreeTools, general service questions). | Q21 citing "Kapitel 9" when the correct reference is "Kapitel 11.2" = false positive. |
| **Source Traceability** | Is the answer grounded in actual source documents? Anti-hallucination check — the facts in the answer must exist in the indexed data, not be fabricated by the model. | Answer states "Kündigung ist 3 Monate" — verified: this fact exists in the Q&A CSV. |

### Scoring

**Binary: PASS or FAIL.** No partial scores.

A question **passes** when:
1. Content accuracy: the answer addresses the customer's intent (user-intent standard)
2. No false chapter reference: the answer either cites the correct chapter, cites no chapter, or the question has no chapter mapping

A question **fails** when:
- The answer is factually wrong or doesn't address the customer's intent, OR
- The answer cites a wrong chapter (false positive — actively misleads)

**Format** and **source traceability** are diagnostic dimensions. They inform what to improve but do not determine PASS/FAIL for the accuracy target. A question can pass with a missing navigation hint — but a missing navigation hint is tracked as an improvement area.

**Target: ≥26/29 (>90%) PASS.** Agreed with Rolnik (2026-01-15): deviations from expected answers count as correct when they address the question's intent from a non-specialist perspective.

### Special Cases

**Intentional non-answers (Q16, Q28):** Questions about pricing where the correct behavior is to redirect to support — not to answer. The "expected answer" for these questions is a support redirect (e.g., "Kontaktieren Sie uns unter dskit@iitr.de"). PASS = redirected without leaking a price. FAIL = gave a price or answered the question directly. Chapter reference and source traceability are N/A for redirect questions.

**Decision source:** Kraska (2026-01-15): "Wollen wir überhaupt die Preise nennen? Eigentlich ja nicht."

### Expected Answer Schema

Each test question follows a three-column format. Stellmacher adds the Source column to the test set.

| Column | Content | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Frage** | The customer's question | "Wo finde ich die Texte für die Webseitendatenschutzerklärung?" |
| **Expected Answer** | The reference answer (key information) | "Texte für die Webseiten-Datenschutzerklärung finden Sie in Kapitel 8." |
| **Source** | Where in the source data the answer lives | "Kapitel 8" or "CSV Zeile 1" |

The Source column enables systematic validation: compare the PageIndex tree traversal path against the expected source location.

### Test Infrastructure

**Ownership (per Dev Lead Witness & Review System, Part 2):**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **JA** | Defines the rubric — this section. What to evaluate, scoring rules, dimension definitions. |
| **Dev Lead** | Provisions the authoritative expected answers. Ensures one version, accessible, up-to-date. |
| **Developer** | Implements the judge prompt from this rubric. Builds and runs the test harness. |

**Existing harness:** `dskit_test_harness.py` on IITR-STAGING provides reusable infrastructure — async OpenWebUI API integration, OpenRouter judge, JSON output. Rewrite the judge prompt to evaluate the four dimensions above. Change scoring from CORRECT/PARTIAL/INCORRECT to binary PASS/FAIL. Expand the test set from 14 to 29 questions. Fix Q10 chapter reference (Kapitel 09 → 11.2, per Stellmacher correction 2026-01-15).
