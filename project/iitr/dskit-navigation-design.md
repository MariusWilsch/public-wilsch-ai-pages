# DS-Kit Navigation — Production Readiness Design
[[client-iitr]]

Rebuilding the DS-Kit Navigation system from scratch using PageIndex (vectorless, tree-based retrieval) to deliver production-ready accuracy on IITR's on-premise infrastructure.

---

## Problem Statement

IITR's DS-Kit product serves ~3,500 customers who regularly contact support with recurring questions (27-28/day per Stellmacher). A navigation system reduces this support load by answering common questions automatically.

A previous prototype (Typesense + chunked RAG) scored 17/29 on the test harness. The chunking approach proved fragile — correct answers existed in the data but vector similarity retrieved wrong chunks. That implementation is being retired.

This project rebuilds the navigation system using PageIndex — a vectorless, tree-based retrieval framework that eliminates chunking entirely. The LLM reasons through a document tree index to find relevant sections, producing traceable, chapter-referenced answers.

**Preconditions:**
- Design artifacts from prior attempt preserved: Pflichtenheft, test questions with source references (29 Q&A + Quelle column), Masterfragen CSV (22 entries), Anwenderleitfaden PDF, 56 DS-Kit templates
- PageIndex benchmarked on IITR-STAGING: Qwen 3.5 9B with think:false achieves ~0.76s per tree traversal call, ~8.5s for full 5-call + answer pipeline (RTX 4000 SFF Ada, 20 GB VRAM)
- Financial reset: prior work uninvoiced, Roman terminated, clean start
- Developer: Dave implements from this design doc, Marius orchestrates as JA

## Success Definition

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | Navigation system is production-ready: accurate answers with chapter-referenced navigation on the 29-question test set |
| **Success** | Test harness scores ≥26/29 (>90%) using PageIndex retrieval. Answers include chapter reference from tree traversal path. Stellmacher/Kraska validate answer quality via sample review. |
| **Done test** | "Can I write a meeting agenda with open design questions?" → If NO → design is complete |

**Test harness mechanism:** Sends each question through PageIndex tree traversal (Qwen 3.5, think:false) to retrieve relevant sections, then generates answer from retrieved context. An LLM judge evaluates semantic correctness against expected answers from the Quelle-mapped test set. PASS/FAIL per question with German-language reasoning.

---

## Infrastructure Baseline

IITR-STAGING hosts the target deployment. Old DS-Kit containers (Typesense, OpenWebUI, TEI, Pipelines) are being retired.

**Available now:**

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 4000 SFF Ada, 20 GB VRAM |
| Ollama | v0.17.7 in Docker (`rag-staging-ollama`, port 11436) |
| Qwen 3.5 9B | Pulled, benchmarked — 0.76s/call with think:false |
| Qwen 3.5 4B | Pulled, benchmarked — 0.67s/call with think:false |

**Access:**
- SSH: `ssh marius@IITR-STAGING`
- Ollama API: `http://localhost:11436/api/generate`
- Docker compose: `/home/shared/projects/IITR-RAG-V1/docker-compose.yml`

**New stack (to deploy):**
- PageIndex (open-source, MIT) — tree index generation + retrieval
- Qwen 3.5 9B via Ollama — tree traversal + answer generation + tree index generation (single model)
- OpenWebUI — chat interface (retained from previous deployment)
- Test harness — automated 29-question evaluation with LLM judge

**Validated (2026-03-09):**
- **PageIndex runs fully local** — 2 patches needed: (1) tiktoken fallback in `utils.py` (`cl100k_base` for Qwen model names), (2) `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var for Ollama routing
- **Qwen 3.5 9B single model** — produces valid structured JSON with `think:false`. Tested against Qwen 3 30B-A3B: 9B wins because `think:false` is ignored on Qwen 3, consuming all tokens on thinking. 9B also produces richer titles and summaries.
- **All 29 test questions sourced** — Navigationssystem FAQ (19/29), Anwenderleitfaden PDF (3/29), DS-Kit Oberfläche chapters (7/29). Full mapping in [epic #959 comment](https://github.com/DaveX2001/deliverable-tracking/issues/959#issuecomment-4021675769).
- **Source data organized** — [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gnxBulrnkGh-Oyly_jabofNo4SVivQhR) with INPUT/ (knowledge base) and TEST_RUBRIK/ (evaluation rubric)

## Approach

Four phases, executed sequentially. Each phase produces a testable artifact before the next begins.

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

Deploy the PageIndex + Ollama + OpenWebUI stack on IITR-STAGING. PageIndex is not currently installed — this is a from-scratch deployment.

**How PageIndex works:** PageIndex transforms documents into hierarchical JSON tree indexes (like a machine-readable table of contents with `title`, `text`, `page_index`, and nested `nodes`). At query time, the LLM receives the tree structure + user query and returns a `{thinking, node_list}` JSON identifying relevant nodes. The selected nodes' text becomes the context for answer generation. No vector database, no chunking — the LLM reasons through the document structure.

- Clone PageIndex repo, apply tiktoken fallback patch for Qwen model names
- Configure Ollama endpoint (`http://localhost:11436/v1`) as PageIndex backend
- Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + dummy API key for PageIndex → Ollama routing
- Rewrite OpenWebUI pipeline filter for PageIndex (the existing `dskit_navigation_filter.py` is Typesense-based and non-functional — `DskitRagBase` import missing). New pipeline: load tree JSON → LLM tree search via Ollama → extract node text → generate answer with chapter references
- Tree indexes stored as JSON files on disk. Multi-document loading strategy (all trees at once vs doc-level routing) depends on actual tree sizes — resolve during implementation
- Build test harness: automated 29-question evaluation against expected answers from [test set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKLPVazIDCVQtpZaR509-NbiVZbjEnmkY44raMdbM2A/edit?gid=492982273)

### 2. Data Preparation

Feed all source documents to PageIndex. PDFs go in directly (PageIndex handles PDF → tree natively). Non-PDF formats need conversion first. Ingest everything — full documents, not cherry-picked by question. Text-only extraction, no visual elements. Note: PageIndex warns that markdown converted from PDF/HTML often loses heading hierarchy — use `--pdf_path` for PDFs, reserve `--md_path` for natively structured markdown.

**Data availability (as of 2026-03-09):**
- Anwenderleitfaden PDF: on staging at `/home/shared/projects/IITR-RAG-V2/data/` and on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzSc_X3yAlv1N55CvrWRAHsqGA7m2ISJ/view)
- Masterfragen + Testfragen: on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gnxBulrnkGh-Oyly_jabofNo4SVivQhR) as Google Sheets
- Templates: TBD — download from `core.iitr.de/tenant/3520/page/82177` (Keycloak auth required) or Marius provides
- Web chapters 1-12: TBD — re-extraction needed as clean markdown (Pass 5). 7/29 test questions depend on these; first evaluation runs on available sources (22/29 questions)

| Source | Format | Conversion | PageIndex Input |
|--------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Anwenderleitfaden | PDF | None | `--pdf_path` |
| Templates (PDF subset) | PDF | None | `--pdf_path` |
| Templates (Word subset) | .docx | Convert to PDF or extract to markdown | `--pdf_path` or `--md_path` |
| Templates (Excel subset) | .xlsx | Convert to structured markdown | `--md_path` |
| Masterfragen (22 Q&A) | CSV/Excel | Convert to structured Q&A markdown | `--md_path` |
| core.iitr.de chapters 1-12 | Web | Scrape → markdown per chapter | `--md_path` |

### 3. Tree Index Generation

Run PageIndex on each prepared document to produce hierarchical tree indexes:

- `python run_pageindex.py --pdf_path <doc> --model qwen3.5:9b` (via Ollama)
- Also supports markdown: `--md_path` for pre-extracted content
- One-time operation per document — regenerate only when source content changes
- Tree indexes enable chapter-referenced answers naturally — the tree traversal path IS the chapter reference (no separate dual-answer prompting needed)

### 4. Evaluation & Iteration

Run the test harness against the 29-question set with Quelle-mapped expected answers. An existing test harness (`dskit_test_harness.py` on staging) provides reusable infrastructure: OpenWebUI API integration, LLM judge with German-language reasoning (Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter), and CORRECT/PARTIAL/INCORRECT scoring. Currently tests 14 questions — expand to the full 29-question set. The judge evaluates against expected key information per question. Iterate on:

- Retrieval prompts (tree traversal instructions)
- Answer generation prompts (format, language, detail level)
- Model selection (Qwen 3.5 4B vs 9B — 4B faster, 9B may be more accurate on edge cases)
- `think:false` confirmed for tree traversal; evaluate whether answer generation benefits from thinking

Target: ≥26/29 (>90%). Present sample answers to Stellmacher for qualitative review at bi-weekly meeting (Mar 17).
