# Proposal: Partnership Restructuring
[[client-paul]]

**To:** Paul
**From:** Marius
**Date:** January 2026
**Re:** Adjusting our partnership terms for the next phase

---

## Context

We've made significant progress on the Tier One product. The v2 platform is deployed at makemyvideo.co.uk, core features are built, and we're approaching launch readiness. However, my situation has changed - I can no longer work on a pure revenue-share basis going forward due to other business commitments.

This proposal maintains our partnership while giving me the cash flow I need to continue.

---

## What I'm Proposing

### 1. Revenue Split: 50/50 (was 60/40)

Given the significant technical investment I've made in building this product - architecture, development, infrastructure - I'm proposing we move to an equal partnership split.

**Why this is fair:**
- I've built ~60% of the product over 10+ intensive days
- I hold the technical knowledge required to maintain and evolve it
- I'll continue leading development through launch and beyond

**Fallback:** If 50/50 feels too far, I'm open to discussing 55/45.

### 2. Monthly Retainer: €2,500/month

To provide me cash flow while we build toward revenue, I'm proposing a monthly retainer.

**How it works:**
- You pay €2,500/month starting immediately
- This amount **credits against my future revenue share**
- Once 50% of net revenue exceeds €2,500/month, the retainer stops
- You're not paying MORE - you're paying EARLIER

**Example:**
```
Pre-revenue: You pay €2,500/month → I get cash flow
Post-revenue (10 customers × €1,200 = €12,000 gross):
  Net after costs: ~€9,000
  My 50%: €4,500
  Your cost: €4,500 (not €4,500 + €2,500)
  Credit absorbs the retainer payments
```

**Minimum floor:** €2,000/month if €2,500 is too high.

### 3. Infrastructure: 50/50

All infrastructure costs (hosting, GPU, API calls) split equally, matching our revenue split.

### 4. Scope & Phases

**Phase 1 (Pre-Launch):** Best effort to reach first paying customer
- Complete remaining blockers (Stripe, avatar, polish)
- Whatever's needed to launch

**Phase 2 (Post-Launch):** Maintenance mode
- We'll renegotiate specific terms (hours, scope) at launch
- Keep it simple for now

### 5. Terms

- **Launch trigger:** First paying customer
- **Non-payment:** If retainer isn't paid, work pauses
- **Developer:** I may hire a developer; they're covered by my retainer (my choice how to allocate)

## Open Items (Known Work to Launch)

| Category | Item | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Payments** | Stripe integration | Critical blocker |
| **Infrastructure** | Tier routing | Subscription enforcement |
| **New Scope** | Avatar (YouTube policy) | Slideshows no longer monetized |
| **Features** | Competition feature | In scope, not built |
| **GPU** | Optimize TTS & image inference times | Reduce individual generation cycle time |
| **Queue** | GPU queue backpressure handling | Prevent cascading timeouts at scale |

---

## What This Means for You

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Short-term cost | €2,500/month (or €2,000 floor) |
| Long-term cost | Same as before - all retainer credits against rev share |
| What you get | Committed technical partner through launch |
| Risk mitigation | I stay engaged vs. you finding replacement |

---

## What This Means for Me

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Cash flow | Predictable income to sustain my business |
| Fair recognition | 50/50 reflects my contribution |
| Flexibility | I can hire help with the retainer |
| Commitment | I'm in this until launch and beyond |

---

## Why This Works for Both of Us

**For you:**
- You keep your technical partner (no expensive replacement search)
- Total cost is same long-term (credit mechanism)
- Launch happens faster with committed developer

**For me:**
- I get cash flow now, not "someday when revenue"
- My contribution is fairly recognized
- I can sustain my business while building yours

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Let's discuss any concerns
3. If aligned, we can formalize with a simple written agreement
4. I continue development immediately
