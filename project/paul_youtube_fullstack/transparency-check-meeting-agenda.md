## Purpose

Get visibility into channel metrics and costs. Gather data now, propose terms in follow-up conversation.

---

## 1. Monetization Stats (Path to Revenue)

- Get hard numbers: subscriber count, watch hours, current revenue (if any)
- Understand YouTube Partner Program status and timeline
- Ask for shared access to YouTube Studio analytics

## 2. My Role on This Project

- Clarify current contribution: built entire platform, pay for infrastructure
- Signal that formalization of arrangement is coming
- Plant seed for follow-up conversation about terms

## 3. Profit Distribution (His Cut)

- Understand what Paul expects to keep vs share
- Current arrangement is undefined - need baseline understanding
- Note: This is information gathering, not negotiation

## 4. Production Costs (Per Video Economics)

- Clarify total cost structure for a typical video
- I pay RunPod TTS and hosting - what other costs exist?
- Request ongoing visibility (shared dashboard or regular reporting)

---

## Strategic Context (For My Eyes Only)

**My Position:**
- Built entire Chatterbox/mynuca platform
- Pay for infrastructure (ongoing operational cost)
- Zero visibility into channel analytics or revenue
- Undefined compensation arrangement

**Meeting Goal:**
- Transparency check, not negotiation
- Leave with: hard numbers + ideally shared access
- Prepare for follow-up: propose formal terms based on what I learn

**Leverage:**
- I control the platform and pay for it
- Without platform, Paul can't produce at this efficiency
- This isn't asking for a favor - it's establishing fair partnership terms
