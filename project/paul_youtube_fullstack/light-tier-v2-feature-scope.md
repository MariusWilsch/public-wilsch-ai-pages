## Overview

**Tier One** = Simplified, sellable version of Paul for small users (1 channel, 1 video/day).

**Architecture:**
- v2 domain with new frontend (Strangler Pattern)
- Supabase Auth + FastAPI backend
- v1 (existing "big boys") and v2 (Tier One) coexist
- Migrate page-by-page, not big bang rewrite

**Key Decision:** New frontend via Strangler Pattern (not feature flags in same codebase).

**Tier Naming:**
- **Tier One** = Simplified tier (this doc)
- **Tier Two+** = Undefined - scope TBD after Tier One launch

## Implementation Approach

**JIT Vertical Slicing** (validated against Strangler Pattern)

### The Pattern

```
Start: Create Video UI (v2, Supabase)
       │
       ▼
   Empty dropdown? ──► Build Niche/Channel entity
       │
       ▼
   FK error (no voices)? ──► Seed Voice data
       │
       ▼
   Keep going until end-to-end works
       │
       ▼
   Move to next feature
```

### Why This Works

1. **Strangler Pattern recommends vertical slices by business domain**, not horizontal technical layers
2. "Extracting by technical layers (database → services → UI) is problematic" - industry consensus
3. Start with user-facing functionality, build dependencies as discovered
4. Scope doc = MAP (what entities exist), Errors = ORDER (when to build each)

### Known Dependencies

When building Create Video UI, these entities will be needed:

| Entity | UI Name | When Needed |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Voice | Voice dropdown | Niche creation / Step 3 |
| ImageStyle | Image Style dropdown | Niche creation / Step 4 |
| VideoGenTemplate | Video Template dropdown | Niche creation |
| PromptConfig | Prompt configuration | Script generation |
| Template | Niche/Channel | Create Video Step 1 |

### Starting Point

**Create Video Flow** → discover → build → continue
