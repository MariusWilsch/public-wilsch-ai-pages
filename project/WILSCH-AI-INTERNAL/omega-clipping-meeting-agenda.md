# Omega AI Video Clipping Service — Meeting Agenda
[[omega-clipping-meeting-agenda]]

Meeting agenda for resolving open design questions from the [design doc](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/WILSCH-AI-INTERNAL/omega-clipping-service-design).

## Meeting Goal

Resolve five open design questions from the AI Video Clipping Service design doc before the proposal and implementation can begin.

1. **Pearl signal definition** — Omega validates the four pearl categories and defines what the AI should detect
2. **Platform priority** — Decide scope for Pinterest (images) and LinkedIn
3. **Content boundaries** — Clarify class structure and student consent for featured clips
4. **Programme structure** — Understand programme tiers and student journey so the service proposal matches the business it supports

## Pre-Read

- [Omega AI Video Clipping Service — Design Doc](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/WILSCH-AI-INTERNAL/omega-clipping-service-design) — specifically the **Undefined** markers in Part 3 (Pearl Taxonomy) and Part 5 (Output Specification)

## Discussion Topics

*Starting points for discussion, not limited to these.*

### 1. Student consent for featured clips
⏱️ 5 min

The Learn to Sing classes were public live streams on YouTube — students joined knowing they were recorded. Using individual students as featured subjects in marketing clips (especially transformation arcs tracking one person across sessions) is a different use case than the original class recording.

- Classes had 10-25 students on camera in Zoom grid format
- Transformation arcs require identifying and featuring specific individuals
- Three students (Simon, Anthony, Ira) are in an active concert program producing story arcs by April

**To resolve:** The consent framework for featuring individual students in marketing clips derived from class recordings.

### 2. Class recording structure
⏱️ 5 min

The AI needs to segment 2-3 hour class recordings into clippable units. The working assumption is: student performs → Omega gives feedback → next student, with ~5 performances per class. Additional structural elements (warm-up, group exercises, introductions) would change how the AI identifies segment boundaries.

- Current classes (e.g., "Learn 2 Sing with Audrey") run ~42 minutes
- Legacy classes (COVID era) ran 2-2.5 hours with ~25 students
- Students choose their own songs

**To resolve:** The typical flow of a class recording from start to finish, including any recurring segments beyond individual performances.

### 3. Platform priority beyond video clips
⏱️ 5 min

Phase 1 covers video clips for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels. Two additional platforms were discussed but not prioritized: Pinterest requires image + text posts (not video), and LinkedIn is where Omega reported making the most money — yet it wasn't discussed as a clip destination.

- Pinterest: "just pictures. Pictures with the words" (Omega)
- LinkedIn: highest revenue platform, corporate gig source
- Each additional platform adds a distinct output pipeline

**To resolve:** Which platforms beyond YT/TT/IG should be included in the service scope, and in what priority order.

### 4. Pearl signal definition for AI detection
⏱️ 10 min

Four pearl categories were identified from the discovery call: coaching feedback moments, authenticity breakthroughs, quotable wisdom, and tidbits. These describe WHAT a pearl is, but the AI needs specific signals to detect them — audio patterns, language cues, or structural markers in the recordings.

- "The meat and potatoes. No salad, no garnish." (Omega on what she wants)
- "Lean into your French accent" — example of coaching feedback pearl
- "I'm not looking for another Whitney Houston" — Omega's teaching philosophy
- The website testimonial format shows the desired narrative arc

**To resolve:** The specific observable signals Omega associates with each pearl category, grounded in examples from her own content.

### 5. Programme pricing and student journey
⏱️ 5 min

The clips feed a funnel: social media → omegabone.com → discovery session → paid programme. Understanding the programme structure and what a student pays at each tier helps scope the service to match the business it supports.

- Three programme tiers discussed (30-day / 90-day / 3.5-month album)
- Discovery session is the entry point (free, 30 min)
- Current student base: ~10 regular students across remote and in-person

**To resolve:** The pricing of each programme tier and how students typically progress through them, so the service proposal can be sized appropriately.

## Meeting Format

- **Type:** Discovery / alignment
- **Duration:** ~30 min
- **Expectation:** Omega reviews the design doc Pre-Read beforehand, brings examples of "pearls" she's already identified in her content
- **Outcome:** All five discussion topics resolved → design doc complete, proposal can be sent
