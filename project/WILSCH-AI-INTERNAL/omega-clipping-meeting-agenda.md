# Omega AI Video Clipping Service — Meeting Agenda
[[omega-clipping-meeting-agenda]]

Meeting agenda for resolving open design questions from the [design doc](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/WILSCH-AI-INTERNAL/omega-clipping-service-design).

## Meeting Goal

Demonstrate proof of concept, resolve open design questions, and align on next steps before sending the proposal.

1. **Pearl POC demo** — Show real examples extracted from Omega's videos, then refine detection criteria together
2. **Student consent** — Clarify consent framework for featuring individual students in marketing clips
3. **Class recording structure** — Understand class flow so AI can segment recordings
4. **Platform priority** — Decide scope for Pinterest (images) and LinkedIn
5. **Programme pricing** — Understand programme tiers and student journey so the service proposal matches the business it supports
6. **Album content** — Decide whether album clips should be included in a future phase
7. **Next steps** — Indicative pricing proposal within 24h

## Pre-Read

- [Omega AI Video Clipping Service — Design Doc](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/WILSCH-AI-INTERNAL/omega-clipping-service-design) — specifically the **Undefined** markers in Part 3 (Pearl Taxonomy) and Part 5 (Output Specification)

## Discussion Topics

*Starting points for discussion, not limited to these.*

### 1. Student consent for featured clips
⏱️ 5 min

The Learn to Sing classes were public live streams on YouTube — students joined knowing they were recorded. Using individual students as featured subjects in marketing clips (especially transformation arcs tracking one person across sessions) is a different use case than the original class recording.

- Classes had 10-25 students on camera in Zoom grid format
- Transformation arcs require identifying and featuring specific individuals
- Three students (Simon, Anthony, Ira) are in an active concert program producing story arcs by April

**To resolve:** The consent framework for featuring individual students in marketing clips derived from class recordings.

### 2. Class recording structure
⏱️ 5 min

The AI needs to segment 2-3 hour class recordings into clippable units. The working assumption is: student performs → Omega gives feedback → next student, with ~5 performances per class. Additional structural elements (warm-up, group exercises, introductions) would change how the AI identifies segment boundaries.

- Current classes (e.g., "Learn 2 Sing with Audrey") run ~42 minutes
- Legacy classes (COVID era) ran 2-2.5 hours with ~25 students
- Students choose their own songs

**To resolve:** The typical flow of a class recording from start to finish, including any recurring segments beyond individual performances.

### 3. Platform priority beyond video clips
⏱️ 5 min

Phase 1 covers video clips for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram Reels. Two additional platforms were discussed but not prioritized: Pinterest requires image + text posts (not video), and LinkedIn is where Omega reported making the most money — yet it wasn't discussed as a clip destination.

- Pinterest: "just pictures. Pictures with the words" (Omega)
- LinkedIn: highest revenue platform, corporate gig source
- Each additional platform adds a distinct output pipeline

**To resolve:** Which platforms beyond YT/TT/IG should be included in the service scope, and in what priority order.

### 4. Pearl POC demo + signal refinement
⏱️ 10 min

We extracted real pearls from three of Omega's Learn to Sing class recordings using AI-powered content detection. This topic opens with showing those examples, then refining the detection criteria together.

- **Pearl examples:** TBD — link to POC results once extracted
- Four pearl categories: coaching feedback, authenticity breakthrough, transformation arc, quotable wisdom
- Each example includes the timestamp, transcript excerpt, and why it qualifies as a pearl
- Omega and Anthony review: "Is this what you'd want to post? What's missing?"

**To resolve:** Validate that the AI finds the right moments. Refine what to detect more of, less of, or differently.

### 5. Programme pricing and student journey
⏱️ 5 min

The clips feed a funnel: social media → omegabone.com → discovery session → paid programme. Understanding the programme structure and what a student pays at each tier helps scope the service to match the business it supports — if the clips bring in even one additional student per month, the service should pay for itself.

- Three programme tiers discussed (30-day / 90-day / 3.5-month album)
- Discovery session is the entry point (free, 30 min)
- Current student base: ~10 regular students across remote and in-person

**To resolve:** The pricing of each programme tier and how students typically progress through them, so the service proposal can be sized appropriately.

### 6. Album clips as future top-of-funnel
⏱️ 5 min

The "Come With Me" album (10 tracks) exists as produced content on YouTube. The current service scope focuses exclusively on Learn to Sing class recordings. Album clips could serve as an awareness channel — bringing in listeners from different genres (hard rock, jazz) who discover Omega's teaching through the music.

- Album = produced music videos, already edited (different format from raw classes)
- Omega described the album as "the top of the funnel" during discovery call
- Processing album content requires different pearl detection (no coaching moments)
- "Maybe not right away" — SA review suggests album as a Phase 2 consideration

**To resolve:** Whether album content should be included in a future phase of the clipping service, and if so, what pearl categories apply to produced music content vs. raw class recordings.

### 7. Next steps
⏱️ 5 min

Wrap up with clear expectations for what happens after the meeting.

- Indicative pricing proposal (Richtpreisangebot) sent within 24 hours
- Proposal anchored on programme pricing discussed in Topic 5
- Timeline for Phase 1 kickoff if both sides agree

**To resolve:** Confirm Omega is comfortable with a 24h turnaround on the proposal and align on any remaining questions.

## Meeting Format

- **Type:** Discovery / alignment + proof of concept demo
- **Duration:** ~40 min
- **Expectation:** Omega reviews the commercial design doc beforehand, brings any questions
- **Outcome:** All seven discussion topics resolved → indicative pricing proposal sent within 24h
