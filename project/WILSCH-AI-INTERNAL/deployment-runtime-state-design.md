# Deployment & Runtime State — Convention Over Configuration
[[docker-deployment]]

Design for eliminating the deployment decision surface through runtime state codification, standardized project recipes, and convention-over-configuration. Absorbs CCI #646 (Deployment & Staging Workflow Not Embodied) and CCI #640 (CI/CD Auto-Deployment).

---

## Problem Statement

A git clone followed by `docker compose up` does not produce a working system. Runtime state — Docker volumes, agent configurations, pipeline prompts, database seeds — lives outside git. When this state is lost, manually recreated, or deployed to the wrong container, every downstream process breaks: testing, verification, and deployment.

This creates a structural gap between the **worktree** (isolated code) and the **running system** (code + runtime state). The developer works in a worktree that represents code, not the system. Testing requires the full system, which only exists on staging — with state that no one version-controls. The gap widens with every manual `docker cp`, every untracked agent definition, every prompt that lives in a volume instead of a file.

Documentation-based fixes (CLAUDE.md deployment identity) do not close this gap. IITR's CLAUDE.md had a 7-section schema including Server Access, Deployment, and Domains — the agent still went to the wrong path twice in the same session. Research confirms: more agent context rules [reduce task success rates while increasing inference cost](https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/your-agents-context-is-a-junk-drawer) (ETH Zurich, 2026), and [passive context outperforms active retrieval](https://vercel.com/blog/agents-md-outperforms-skills-in-our-agent-evals) by eliminating decision points (Vercel, 2026). Adding more instructions to CLAUDE.md — including deployment identity — increases noise in a context window where every line competes for the agent's attention.

The fix is structural, not informational: everything needed to produce a working system must be derivable from git.

**Preconditions:**
- Self-hosted Docker Compose backends across multiple servers
- Worktree-based development (code isolation, draft PRs)
- AI agents making deployment decisions (container selection, path routing, Docker commands)
- Multiple deployment targets per project (staging + production, sometimes multiple servers)

## Success Definition

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | Git is the single source of truth. The running system is derived from it — deterministically, without manual steps, without agent decisions about infrastructure. |
| **Success** | A developer creates a worktree for an issue and receives a testable running system (not just isolated code). Push to staging branch produces a deployed, verifiable system. No SSH. No manual Docker commands. No CLAUDE.md deployment instructions. |
| **Done test** | Clone any project repo. Run compose + seed with only `.env` credentials. Result: a working system indistinguishable from staging. If any manual step is required beyond `git clone` + `docker compose up` + `seed`, the recipe is incomplete. |

---

## Approach

### Part 1 — The Three Layers

A Docker backend has three layers. The deployment confusion pattern (#646, #635) always originates in Layer 3.

| Layer | What | In Git? | Reproducible? |
|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| **Code** | Application source, tests, configs | Yes | Yes — `git clone` |
| **Container images** | Docker build from code | Derived | Yes — `docker compose build` |
| **Runtime state** | Volumes, agent configs, DB seeds, prompts, Caddy routing | Partially | No — manual reconstruction |

Layer 1 and 2 are solved. Worktrees isolate code. Docker builds images deterministically from code. The entire Ship with Confidence workflow (AC verify, smoke test, human witness) operates on Layer 1 and 2.

Layer 3 is where state lives outside git:
- **LibreChat agent definitions** live in MongoDB, not in code (Archibus #1189: deployed to wrong container volume)
- **Pipeline prompts** deployed via `docker cp`, never committed (IITR #1191 Finding 4: golden prompt lost during migration)
- **Database state** seeded manually after container startup
- **Caddy routing** configured via SSH, not version-controlled per project

Every deployment failure in the CCI #646 evidence chain traces back to Layer 3. The fix targets this layer specifically.

### Part 2 — Git = Truth

The direction of truth flips:

| | Today | Convention |
|---|-------|-----------|
| **Truth lives in** | Running system (staging server) | Git repository |
| **Git contains** | Partial copy (code + compose) | Complete recipe (code + compose + seed) |
| **Deploy means** | Manual reconstruction of runtime state | Automated derivation from git |
| **State drift** | Accumulates silently between deploys | Impossible — every deploy starts from recipe |

This is the same principle as infrastructure-as-code (Terraform), applied to Docker runtime state. The system state IS the code.

**What can be codified:**

| Component | Codification method | Already done? |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| DB schemas | Migration scripts | Yes (most projects) |
| DB seed data | SQL/JSON seed scripts in `seed/` | Rarely |
| Pipeline filters / prompts | Git-tracked files, volume-mounted | IITR fixed post-Finding 4 |
| LibreChat agent definitions | MongoDB seed scripts (JSON export) | No — [feature requested upstream](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/discussions/10019) |
| Caddy routing | `.conf` files in repo, deployed with project | IITR partially |
| Docker networking | Defined in docker-compose.yml | Yes |

**What cannot be codified (irreducible):**
- **Credentials** — `.env` files, gitignored. Injected from secrets management or manual setup.
- **GPU hardware** — Ollama on IBM Power or dedicated GPU servers. Physical constraint.
- **External service state** — IMAP inboxes, third-party API state. Real-world dependency.

The convention requires: everything above the irreducible line MUST be in git. Everything below is accepted as an external dependency with a documented injection point.

### Part 3 — The Recipe Convention

Every project ships with a **recipe**: the complete set of instructions to produce a working system from a git clone. The recipe is not documentation — it is executable code.

**Standard project structure:**

```
project-root/
├── docker-compose.yml          # Layer 2: container definitions
├── docker-compose.staging.yml  # Environment override (staging)
├── docker-compose.prod.yml     # Environment override (production)
├── seed/                       # Layer 3: runtime state
│   ├── seed.sh                 # Entrypoint: runs all seed steps in order
│   ├── db/                     # Database migrations + seed data
│   ├── agents/                 # Agent definitions (JSON exports)
│   ├── prompts/                # System prompts, pipeline filters
│   └── caddy/                  # Caddy .conf for this project's domains
├── .env.example                # Credential template (injection points)
└── Makefile                    # Developer interface: make up, make seed, make staging
```

**The litmus test:** `cp .env.example .env && <fill credentials> && docker compose up -d && ./seed/seed.sh` produces a working system. If it doesn't, the recipe is incomplete.

**Makefile as convention surface:**

| Target | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `make up` | Start all containers (compose up) |
| `make seed` | Run seed/seed.sh (populate runtime state) |
| `make staging` | Full staging deploy (up + seed + health check) |
| `make health` | Verify system health (curl endpoints, check containers) |

The Makefile is the only interface the developer (or CI/CD, or platform) uses. No raw Docker commands. No SSH into containers. The Makefile IS the convention.

**Undefined:** Concrete recipe contents per project type (ROHDEX simple backend vs. IITR two-layer compose vs. Archibus LibreChat with agent state). Requires per-project audit in next extraction pass.

**Undefined:** Staging → git reverse flow — when runtime state is created manually on staging (e.g., new agent configured via LibreChat UI), how does it get exported back into the `seed/` directory? This is the maintenance cycle for recipes.

### Part 4 — Preview Environments: Closing the Worktree Gap

The worktree gives the developer isolated code. The recipe defines a reproducible system. A **preview environment** connects the two: when a worktree creates a PR, a platform automatically spins up the recipe into a running system with its own URL.

**Target flow:**

1. Developer creates worktree → worktree skill creates draft PR (existing behavior)
2. Platform detects PR → runs `docker compose up` + `seed/seed.sh` from that branch
3. Preview URL assigned (e.g., `issue-1189.wilsch-deployment.com`)
4. Developer has: code locally (worktree) + running system remotely (preview)
5. PR merged or closed → preview torn down automatically

This is the Vercel model applied to Docker backends. The developer never SSHs. The agent never chooses a container. The platform IS the deployment.

**Self-hosted PaaS options evaluated:**

| Platform | Preview PRs | CLI | Server overhead | Fit |
|----------|------------|-----|-----------------|-----|
| **Coolify** | Built-in (GitHub App) | Limited | Server daemon | Strongest preview support |
| **Dokploy** | Supported | Limited | Docker Swarm | Better multi-server |
| **Kamal** (37signals) | Not supported | CLI-first | Zero daemon | No preview environments |

Coolify and Dokploy both provide the preview environment primitive. Kamal does not — it solves deployment automation but not the worktree→system gap.

**The platform does it, not the agent.** The agent writes code and pushes. The platform reacts to the push. No AI involvement in infrastructure decisions.

**Undefined:** Development topology — does the developer work locally (worktree) with a remote preview on the server? Or does development happen on the server directly? GPU-dependent services (IITR Ollama) cannot run locally — the preview environment on the server must provide them. Hybrid model likely needed.

**Undefined:** Platform selection — Coolify vs Dokploy requires a spike. Evaluation criteria: preview environment quality, Docker Compose support, CLI/API access, resource overhead on WILSCH-AI-SERVER.

**Undefined:** Worktree skill integration — the current worktree skill (Step 5) asks about Docker volume copying. With preview environments, Step 5 changes: instead of copying volumes locally, the platform spins up a preview from the recipe. How does the worktree skill encode this? Does it trigger the platform via API? Or does the PR creation (Step 4) already trigger the platform automatically via GitHub App webhook?

### Part 5 — CLAUDE.md Implications: What Dies, What Stays

The Vercel AGENTS.md research and Augment's "junk drawer" analysis converge on one finding: agent context files should contain only what prevents specific failures the agent would otherwise make. Everything else is noise that degrades performance.

Applied to deployment, combined with CCI #659 (CLAUDE.md as Router):

**What dies (platform handles it):**
- Deployment identity (container name, port, server path) — the recipe IS the identity
- Branch→server mapping — the platform routes branches to environments
- `make staging` instructions — CI/CD or platform triggers on push
- Caddy subdomain convention — platform manages routing
- SSH access details — no one SSHs anymore

**What stays (prevents failures the agent would make):**
- Build/test/run commands (`uv sync`, `uv run pytest`)
- Known gotchas that aren't in code (e.g., "temperature 0 for RAG with small models")
- Architecture decisions not obvious from reading code
- Credential locations (which `.env` vars are needed, where to get them)
- Route to recipe: `→ See seed/ for runtime state setup`

**The filter (from Augment):** For each CLAUDE.md line, ask: "Would the agent make a mistake without this?" If no — delete it. If the answer is "yes, but the recipe or platform handles it now" — also delete it.

This aligns with #659's router principle: CLAUDE.md routes to source files where truth lives. The recipe (`seed/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`) IS the source of deployment truth. CLAUDE.md doesn't restate it.

**Undefined:** Recipe authorship — who writes and maintains the `seed/` directory for each project? Candidates: (1) JA defines recipe requirements in the design doc as part of the Approach (e.g., "this project needs agent seed scripts + prompt files"), then Developer implements them during the implementation session. (2) Recipe becomes a standard section in every design doc, like ACs. (3) Recipe is infrastructure work owned by the SA/System Engineer, not the Developer. Needs position-level clarity.
