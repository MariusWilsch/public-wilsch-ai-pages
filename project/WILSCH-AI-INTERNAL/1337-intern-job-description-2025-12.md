# AI Development Intern - Job Description
[[david-collaboration]]

**Company:** Wilsch AI Services OÜ
**Location:** Remote (Morocco timezone preferred)
**Type:** Contractor (part-time to start, potential full-time)
**Stack:** React, Python (FastAPI/Flask), PostgreSQL

---

## The Way We Work

**This isn't a typical development role.**

We use AI pair programming where you navigate and the AI drives. You provide judgment calls and preferences. The AI investigates what's discoverable, knows what to figure out vs what to ask you, then executes after verified understanding.

Think of it like navigator/driver pair programming:
- **You (Navigator):** Provide preferences, make decisions, set direction
- **AI (Driver):** Investigates context, disambiguates requirements, executes code

We call this the **clarity workflow**. Before any code gets written:
1. Requirements get disambiguated (what are we building?)
2. Implementation gets planned (how will we build it?)
3. Success criteria get defined (how do we know it works?)
4. Only then: execution

This ensures that even on a bad day, the work follows a consistent, verifiable process.

**Why this matters:** Previous hires struggled because we work differently. If you've always written every line yourself, this will feel foreign. If you're skeptical of AI or uncomfortable letting it execute after alignment, this isn't the right fit.

---

## This Role is NOT For You If...

Be honest with yourself. This role won't work if you:

1. **Prefer defining your own workflow** - You'll be learning and following our clarity workflow, not bringing your own process
2. **Need to personally control every line of code** - AI handles execution after you provide direction
3. **Expect to use your established process from day one** - You can bring experience, but must adopt our workflow first
4. **Are skeptical of AI-assisted development** - This is the core of how we work

We're serving food that's spicy for most palates. That's not a judgment - it's just honest. Some people love it, some don't.

## What You'll Do

**Generalist execution across client projects.**

You'll work on whatever comes to the table - we're an AI agency serving multiple clients. One day might be a React frontend feature, the next a FastAPI endpoint, the next a database migration.

**Day-to-day:**
- Pick up tickets assigned to you during daily grooming
- Use the clarity workflow to disambiguate and execute
- Work with standard stack: React (Vite) + Python (FastAPI/Flask) + PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Context switch between client projects as needed

**What "generalist tickets" means:**
- Feature implementation (frontend or backend)
- Bug fixes
- API integrations
- Database changes
- Testing

**Delegatable task criteria** (what gets assigned to you):
- Clear Definition of Done
- Standard stack (no exotic dependencies)
- Low decision authority (no client-facing decisions)
- Recoverable if wrong (mistakes caught in review)

## Technical Requirements

Secondary to process fit, but still important:

| Skill | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| React | Core | Vite preferred |
| Python | Core | FastAPI or Flask |
| PostgreSQL | Core | Supabase experience a plus |
| Git/GitHub | Core | PR workflow, issue tracking |
| AI tools | Critical | Must be comfortable with Claude/AI-assisted development |

**More important than technical skills:** Willingness to learn the clarity workflow and work within a structured AI-assisted process.

---

## Logistics

**Location:** Remote (Morocco timezone preferred for overlap)
**Type:** Contractor model
**Hours:** Start part-time, ramp to full-time based on mutual fit
**Communication:** Async primary, daily grooming sync

**Ramp-up approach:**
- Start small (not 40 hours immediately)
- Build trust and workflow familiarity
- Expand scope as alignment proves out

---

## Interview Process

We test for **moldability** - your ability to adapt to our workflow.

### Three-Phase Delta Test

| Phase | What Happens | What We Observe |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Phase 1** | "Here's a task. Let's use Claude." (no explanation) | Your natural behavior - do you ask questions? dive in? |
| **Phase 2** | We explain the clarity workflow (navigator/driver) | Your understanding |
| **Phase 3** | Continue with the new understanding | How quickly you adapt |

**What the delta reveals:**

| Type | Phase 1 | Phase 3 | Verdict |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Natural fit** | Already disambiguates | Same | Hire |
| **Moldable** | Dives in | Adapts quickly | Hire |
| **Rigid** | Dives in | Still dives in | Pass |

Both natural fit and moldable work. Zero delta = disqualifying.

## Operational Workflow

Once hired, here's how work flows:

### Daily Grooming (You Participate)

**Who:** Marius + David + You
**When:** Daily sync (5-10 min)
**What:** Review backlog items, assign tasks, clarify context

**The Four Questions (per item):**
1. Assignee correct? (Marius / David / You)
2. Blocked or ready?
3. Context clear?
4. Maker or manager task?

### Your Work Queue

Items assigned to you during grooming appear in your queue:
- All items have Definition of Done
- All items are ready to execute (grooming quality gate)
- You pick from your assigned items

### Review Process

**All your PRs get reviewed:**
- Marius reviews with AI assistance
- Feedback on both code and workflow adherence
- Learning opportunity, not punishment

### Definition of Ready (for your items)

You only receive items that are:
- [ ] Assigned to you
- [ ] Not blocked
- [ ] Has clear Definition of Done
- [ ] Context is complete

## Why This Role Exists

**We need more throughput.** There's plenty of work, but limited execution capacity.

**Secondary goal:** Validate that the clarity workflow scales beyond one person. If you succeed, it proves the system works with additional executors.

---

## Apply

If this resonates - if you're genuinely excited about working with AI, not just tolerating it - reach out.

**What to include:**
- Your experience with React + Python
- Any AI tool experience (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- Why this workflow sounds interesting (or concerning)
