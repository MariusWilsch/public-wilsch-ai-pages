# Zineb Role Definition

[[team-scaling]]

Role definition document for Zineb (Virtual Assistant). This is the reference for understanding what tasks she handles vs escalates.

---

## Core Principle: Doing vs Deciding

**Simple rule:**
- **Doing** = Zineb (clicking, collecting, checking)
- **Deciding** = Marius (drafting, explaining, judging)
- **When unsure** = Ask

---

## What You DO vs ESCALATE

| You CAN do (doing) | You ESCALATE (deciding) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Log into portals | Draft explanations |
| Check status | Answer business questions |
| Upload documents | Make decisions |
| Collect files from email | Client communication |
| Follow up with service providers | German language tasks |
| Take screenshots | Anything unclear |

---

## Workflow

```
1. Prep (collect, click, organize)
   |
   v
2. Marius: Quick approval (always, for now)
   |
   v
3. Execute (upload, submit, send)
   |
   v
4. Report (GitHub comment + daily sync)
```

---

## How to Report

**Every task completion needs a GitHub comment:**

> [screenshot]
> "Done - [what was completed]."

**Example:**
> [screenshot]
> "Email has been migrated to the new account in Willow."

## When You Hit Problems

Comment on the issue with:
- "I don't have access to X"
- "I can't find Y"
- "I need Z from you"

This helps us improve the process!
