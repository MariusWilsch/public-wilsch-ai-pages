# Monthly Plan — February 23 – March 31, 2026
[[coo-position]]

First monthly plan. Testing: if monthly pre-decides direction and daily enforces it, daily judgment shifts from WHAT to work on to HOW to advance.

## 🎯 Position Map — Where Do We Want to Be by March 31?

> **Every task you pick today either moves you toward manager-only or keeps you stuck as a worker. Which one is it?**

**Worker positions:** Developer, Junior Architect (JA)
**Manager positions:** Dev Lead, Solution Architect

### Now

| Position | Marius | David | AI |
|----------|--------|-------|----|
| **JA** (worker) | Archibus, IITR, UWI, AVO, Abtmayr | — | — |
| **Developer** (worker) | Archibus | IITR, UWI, Abtmayr | AVO |
| **Dev Lead** (manager) | IITR, Abtmayr | — | — |
| **Solution Architect** (manager) | — | — | — |

**Marius: 6 worker, 2 manager** — still doing the work instead of leading it.

### March 31

| Position | Marius | David | AI |
|----------|--------|-------|----|
| **JA** (worker) | ≤1 project | Holds across projects | — |
| **Developer** (worker) | ≤1 project (max, ever) | Holds across projects | AVO |
| **Dev Lead** (manager) | All projects | — | — |
| **Solution Architect** (manager) | All projects | — | — |

**Marius: manager only. David holds the worker positions. This is how you scale.**

## Docket

### Archibus → AI Bulk Data Entry (#373)

| Role | Who | Friction |
|------|-----|----------|
| JA | Marius | Decomposition into developer issues |
| Developer | Marius | — |

**Forcing function:** Weekly all-hands (Thursday)

**Why:** Archibus is the primary proving ground for the Traceline position methodology. The JA→Developer decomposition — turning design docs into implementable developer issues via the Issue Lifecycle Router — is the core friction point across all projects, and Archibus is where it gets practiced most intensively. This project is fully owned: no Dev Lead friction from reviewing other people's code, just the pure design-to-implementation pipeline. Every improvement to the JA→Developer handoff here transfers directly to how David receives work on IITR and Abtmayr-Reichert. The contract is extended 6 months and closest to the desired retainer model — making it the stable anchor for methodology development.

### IITR → DS-Kit RAG

| Role | Who | Friction |
|------|-----|----------|
| JA | Marius | Decomposition handoff |
| Developer | David | — |
| Dev Lead | Marius | Learning to review code |

**Forcing function:** ASAP (overdue)

**Why:** IITR exercises two position touchpoints that don't exist anywhere else right now. First, the JA side: decomposing design docs into issues that David can execute — the same friction as Archibus but with a real handoff to another human. Second, the Dev Lead side: reviewing David's code and learning what good review looks like. David already proved he can complete decomposition independently on this project — the open question is why he doesn't struggle where Marius does. Understanding that asymmetry is the real learning. The project is overdue due to a legal dispute blocking progress, which makes every session high-value: limited time means maximum extraction per touchpoint.

### UWI → Call2Tanss + misc (#833)

| Role | Who | Friction |
|------|-----|----------|
| JA | Marius | Extracting requirements from unclear executive |
| Developer | David | — |

**Forcing function:** Daily sync (workdays)

**Why:** UWI is the JA extraction masterclass. The client executive is busy, unclear in framing requirements, and generates a constant stream of small tasks rather than one big project. The core skill being developed: how to extract structured requirements from someone who can't articulate what they want. This is the most transferable friction point — every client has unclear requirements, but UWI makes it the primary challenge rather than a side effect. The work itself is straightforward enough that David can execute without friction, which isolates the JA extraction as the bottleneck to improve. Daily sync cadence means this package gets touched in manager time every day regardless of which package gets maker blocks.

### AVO → KI Sossen Sourcing POC (#513)

| Role | Who | Friction |
|------|-----|----------|
| JA | Marius | Issue design |
| Developer | Autonomous coder (AI) | Path B on local IBM Power; Path A = stretch |

**Forcing function:** Biweekly meetings

**Why:** AVO is the R&D laboratory for the autonomous coder — testing whether AI can handle Path B (spec-implement) on local IBM Power development without human intervention. If spec-implement works autonomously on local dev, the agency's delivery model scales beyond human developer hours. Path A (spec-design autonomous) is the stretch goal — if the AI can also design issues from requirements, the entire delivery pipeline becomes AI-native. This is also the first project with Ulrich (dad), which adds personal delivery accountability that other R&D work doesn't have. AVO and Rekers share the same friction pattern: both are bigger projects ideal for testing autonomous capabilities under real client pressure.

### Abtmayr-Reichert → Website (#726, #759)

| Role | Who | Friction |
|------|-----|----------|
| JA | Marius | Does handoff generalize across project types? |
| Developer | David | — |
| Dev Lead | Marius | Retainer conversion (#847) |

**Forcing function:** TBD (needs check-in cadence with client)

**Why:** Abtmayr-Reichert is the retainer conversion testing ground. The current contract type was a mistake — this project needs to be restructured into the retainer model being designed in #847. The JA→Developer handoff with David is the same pattern as IITR but with different project dynamics (website vs RAG), which tests whether the handoff methodology generalizes across project types. The key business goal: turn this client into one of the target retainers, which directly feeds the revenue target of 10K/month agency. Establishing a regular check-in cadence with the client is an open action — without it, there's no external forcing function driving urgency.

## Revenue Forecast

**Agency target: €8,000/month** (Level 1 salary + Level 2 nest egg + expenses)

| Client | €/month | Type | Count it | Contract ends | Owner | Goal |
|--------|---------|------|----------|---------------|-------|------|
| Archibus | 3,000 | Retainer (mix) | Yes | Aug 2026 | Marius | Keep + define success fee by Feb 28 |
| UWI | 3,000 | Retainer + SLA | Yes | Mar 2026 (renegotiating) | Marius/David | Convert to consolidated retainer |
| Abtmayr | ~2,500–3,800 | T&M @120/hr | Yes | Indefinite | David | Convert to fixed-price or retainer |
| Rekers | ~2,818 | Fixed-price (WS2, 50/50 split) | Yes | One-off (delivered) | Marius | Invoice, then POC next |
| IITR | 2,880 | Fixed-price | No | When delivered | David | Clear legal dispute + decide framework |
| Rohdex | 325–525 | SLA + T&M @90/hr | No | Ongoing | David | Keep SLA (reactive) |
| AVO | 0 | — | No | — | Marius | First milestone → April |

**Countable: ~€11,318–12,618** | **Surplus if arrives: ~€3,200–3,400**

## Pre-Decisions

- **New leads:** Yes — one more retainer, no more. When signed, pipeline closes.
- **Why:** Focus is on making what we have work. One additional rock-solid revenue source reduces single-client dependency (only Archibus is fully contracted) AND serves as a learning opportunity to work out the retainer model. Not growth — redundancy + model validation.
- **Constraint:** One. Not two, not three. The rest of the energy goes into delivering on the current docket.

- Why: Daily touchpoint with client, meeting at 1pm — need meeting agenda prepared. JA extraction masterclass.
- Key: meeting agenda creation

**Slot 2: IITR → Dev Lead**
- Why: Tuesday meeting coming, need to review David's epic delivery. First real Dev Lead review exercise.
- Key: epic review + meeting agenda prep
