# Your AI Department — Without Building One
[[project-index-847]]

Universal pitch flyer for Wilsch AI Services — outsourced AI department model. Two-page format with three opening variants for A/B testing with Ulrich's network.

---

## Opening A: Problem → Solution

Every company needs AI capability — it's becoming as foundational as marketing or IT. Most mid-market companies can't build it internally: the talent is scarce, the technology moves too fast, and the risk of getting it wrong is expensive.

You don't need to build an AI department. You can outsource it.

Wilsch AI Services operates as your external AI department — delivering outcomes, not tools.

---

## Opening B: Value-first

An AI department without building one.

Wilsch AI Services gives your company access to AI-native delivery capability across every department — production, marketing, finance, customer service. You get a dedicated team backed by AI orchestration technology that delivers monthly outcomes. No hiring. No internal build. No off-the-shelf tool you have to figure out yourself.

---

## Opening C: Vision → Offer

The companies that will lead their markets in the next five years are the ones where every employee works with AI — where workers shift from manual execution to managing AI-powered processes, and institutional knowledge stays in the system even when people leave.

Wilsch AI Services makes this transition real. We operate as your outsourced AI department: identifying possibilities across your organization, delivering outcomes, and building your team's AI capability from the inside out.

---

## What You Get: An Outsourced AI Department

Unlike AI software tools that require your team to learn, configure, and maintain them, we deliver a function. Your outsourced AI department handles the AI methodology, orchestration, and delivery — you focus on your business.

What makes this department unique: AI capability touches every other department. Marketing, operations, finance, production, customer service — each one has processes that AI can transform. When one department sees the results, others follow.

**What this looks like in practice:**

- **Engineering / IT:** [AI development with full data sovereignty](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/wilsch-group/local-ai-development-customer) — local deployment on your infrastructure, no data leaves your company
- **Operations / Onboarding:** AI-powered bulk data entry that reduces days of manual data reformatting to minutes — AI maps messy spreadsheets to your system schema, validates each entry, and asks clarifying questions instead of guessing wrong ([see demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeEejHLOTt8))
- **Production:** In one engagement scoped for software, the production department asked to join after the first workshop — they saw possibilities no one had anticipated

> *"You are a gear in the Swiss watch"* — a client who chose the retainer model for ongoing strategic access

This isn't consulting. This isn't a project that ends. It's an ongoing function that grows as your company discovers what AI makes possible.

## How We Deliver

Your team doesn't shrink — it levels up. Each person shifts from manual execution to managing AI-powered processes. Institutional knowledge stays in the system, not in someone's head. When people move on, the capability remains.

<img src="assets/org-chart-before-after.png" alt="Before: Traditional org chart — many workers, manual output. After: AI-Native — fewer manual roles, AI Managers directing AI Agents, higher automated output." style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">

We operate as a methodology architect with concurrent engagements — delivering from the outside, not embedded inside your company. The AI delivery system produces a complete audit trail: every action, every decision is traceable. This observability replaces timesheets — it's more transparent than any person could be.

## Pricing: Aligned Incentives

A full-time AI hire costs €70,000–80,000+ per year — for one person, one department. Our outsourced AI department covers multiple departments at a fraction of the cost.

Every engagement has two components:

- **Base retainer** — guaranteed access to the AI delivery system and a dedicated specialist trained in our AI systems. Think of it as Betriebskosten, not Projektkosten — a running operating cost, like your IT or accounting function.
- **Success component** — a share of the commercial outcome the work enables. We succeed when you succeed. This isn't an additional cost — it's earned value tied to measurable results.

## How We're Different

| | AI Software Tools | Your AI Department (Wilsch AI) |
|--|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **What you get** | A tool to configure yourself | A function that delivers outcomes |
| **AI expertise required** | Yes — your team must learn it | No — we bring the methodology |
| **Data sovereignty** | Cloud-dependent | Local deployment available |
| **Scales with you** | Per-user pricing | Function grows as needs grow |
| **Examples** | tune.eco (€149/mo), heronos (€375/mo), mindgpt | Base retainer + success component |

## Get Started

Start with a free scoping workshop — we identify your AI potential in a focused session, with no commitment. From there, we design an engagement that fits your needs.
