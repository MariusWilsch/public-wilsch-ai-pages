# Plug/Opera — Your Fractional AI Department
[[project-index-847]]

Proposal for Stafford — how Wilsch AI Services delivers the AI infrastructure for Plug/Opera. Walk-through document for next conversation.

## What You Said

> "Could you help create me an AI agent?"

> "I'm trying to get this thing built and built with someone that I can work with going forward."

> "I like how you think. We think similar. We can get on, we can get some good things to happen."

You want a long-term build partner for Plug/Opera — not a contractor who builds for £3K and disappears. You want someone who understands AI deeply enough to architect the 3-4 agents that power every funnel, build the CRM, and keep margins high as you scale.

Here's what that looks like.

## What You're Getting: A Fractional AI Department

Most AI providers give you a developer. You get a person, they build, they leave. The knowledge leaves with them.

We deliver a **fractional AI department** — a trained AI system that works your way, operated by our team, with full transparency into everything it does.

### How It Works

You know ChatGPT — you type a question, you get advice. That's useful, but advice doesn't build products.

We go further. We train AI to work like a specific role in your organization:

1. **Employee Handbook** — We define the AI's role: what it builds, what authority it has, what quality standards it follows. This is a documented file, not knowledge in someone's head.

2. **Standard Procedures** — Step-by-step workflows that guide the AI through each task. Before coding starts, the AI verifies: "What exactly are we building? Is it clear? How do we test it?" No guessing.

3. **Specialist Knowledge** — The AI loads expertise on demand — your project's conventions, your architecture patterns, your deployment setup. Like an employee who knows where the company manuals are without being told.

4. **Quality Guardrails** — Automatic checks that catch mistakes before they ship. If the AI takes a shortcut, the guardrail blocks it.

**The result:** Consistent quality, every project. The system is documented — when a person moves on, the AI keeps working the same way. The 10th funnel runs smoother than the 1st because the system improves with every build.

This methodology is model-agnostic — it works across AI platforms, including local deployment for full data sovereignty if needed.

## Why This Costs What It Costs

You have quotes: £1,500 from one developer, £3,000 from a 25-year engineer. Those are prices for a person's time on a single build.

What you're paying for here is different:

| | One-off developer | Fractional AI department |
|---|---|---|
| **What you get** | A build | A system that builds |
| **When they leave** | Knowledge leaves | System stays, documented |
| **Quality** | Depends on the person | Same process every time |
| **Scaling** | Hire again for each funnel | Same system spins up new funnels |
| **Improvement** | Starts from scratch | Each build is better than the last |
| **Your role** | Manage the developer | Direct the department |

The £3K quote builds V2 once. The fractional AI department builds V2, then scales to 100+ funnels using the same trained AI infrastructure — each funnel faster and cheaper than the last.

## Two Paths Forward

### Path A: Fixed-Price First Project
**What:** We build the core AI agent infrastructure for Plug/Opera V2 — the 3-4 agents that power any funnel configuration — as a scoped, fixed-price project.

**Why this path:** You see the system in action before committing to a retainer. You pay for a deliverable, not a promise. Low risk.

**What happens after:** If the build proves the system works (it will), we transition to retainer for ongoing funnel development, CRM, and scaling.

### Path B: Retainer from Day One
**What:** The Plug/Opera V2 build becomes part of a retainer engagement. Base fee + success component tied to Plug/Opera revenue.

**Why this path:** You get the full fractional AI department immediately — not just the build, but ongoing architecture decisions, funnel scaling, and the AI agent you asked about. The agent is part of the retainer, not a separate purchase.

**What's included that fixed-price isn't:**
- Your own AI agent (trained on your processes, your conventions)
- Ongoing architecture decisions as you scale to 100+ funnels
- CRM integration and virality engineering
- Monthly outcome reports replacing timesheets — full transparency

### Path C: Transition (Recommended)
**What:** Start with a fixed-price first project (Path A). Once delivered, transition to retainer (Path B) for everything that follows.

**Why this path:** You see proof before committing long-term. The first project builds trust on both sides. The transition to retainer is natural — you'll want the ongoing department, not just the build.

## The AI Agent You Asked About

> "Could you help create me an AI agent?"

Yes — but an agent without training is just ChatGPT with tools. What makes it useful is the methodology: the employee handbook, the procedures, the expertise, the guardrails.

Building you an AI agent means:
1. We extract knowledge from your team (how Plug/Opera works, your conventions, your quality standards)
2. We build the agent (trained on YOUR processes, not generic AI)
3. We train your operators to manage it
4. You run it independently — the system stays with you

This is a retainer deliverable. The agent is built during the engagement and gets smarter over time as the system captures knowledge from every interaction.

## What You See

**Full transparency.** Every AI action, every decision, every piece of work — traceable. The system produces a complete audit trail. You don't need timesheets — you can see exactly what your fractional AI department has been doing at any point.

**Consistent process.** The [Developer Operations Manual](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/global/developer-operations-manual-wilsch-ai-services) shows how every task follows the same lifecycle: think through what to build → build it → verify it works → ship it. Same process, every time.

**Real proof.** This isn't a pitch deck — this is a system already in production. The methodology powers our own [organization](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/global/operations-manual-router), and our product [Traceline](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/traceline/developer-position-beta-scope) packages it for distribution. You're not the first — you're joining a proven system.
