# Meeting-Agenda: Contract Strategy — Undefined Elements
[[project-index-847]]

## Meeting Goal

This meeting resolves the four undefined elements in the Contract Strategy design doc — the mechanics that couldn't be defined from extraction alone and need either empirical data or deeper probing.

1. **Revenue share structure** — define the standard model for how success fees are calculated across different client types
2. **Outcome report format** — design the weekly report that replaces timesheets
3. **Success fee lifecycle** — define when and how the success component outcompetes the base retainer
4. **Success fee as client filter** — frame the success fee conversation as mutual qualification

## Pre-Read

- [Contract Strategy Design Doc](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/soloforce/contract-strategy-retainer-model-design) — focus on Undefined markers in Parts 3 and 5
- [Archibus Retainer Agreement](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/archibus-fm-assistant/archibus-retainer-services-agreement-6mo-extension) — Section 2.2 (revenue share pending)
- [UWI Consolidation Agenda](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/uwi-retainer/meeting-agenda-contract-consolidation) — outcome reporting proposal

## Discussion Topics

*Starting points for discussion, not limited to these.*

### 1. Revenue share structure varies by client type but has no standard model
⏱️ 15 min

The success component is margin-dependent and negotiated per deal, but no framework exists for determining the percentage. Archibus has a revenue share deadline of February 28, 2026 with no structure defined. UWI's success component comes from projects sold jointly.

- Archibus: product subscription revenue → what percentage of net margin?
- UWI: joint project sales → share of the project price or the margin?
- Collaborator precedent: 5-10% of net margin was discussed, capped at £50K/month
- Each client's margins differ — product SaaS margins vs. services project margins vs. hardware resale margins

**To resolve:** A decision framework for setting the success fee percentage based on client type, margin profile, and Wilsch AI's contribution to the revenue stream.

### 2. Weekly outcome reports replace timesheets but the format is undefined
⏱️ 10 min

The design doc specifies outcome reporting as the replacement for hourly timesheets — weekly problem-solution pairs with business value framing, linked to design docs. The principle is clear; the format needs empirical testing.

- UWI consolidation agenda proposed "Wöchentliches Ergebnis-Protokoll" — initially manual, later automated
- Possible format: problem statement + solution delivered + business value created, with link to associated design doc or executive summary
- The report must be quick to produce (not a burden that replaces timesheets with equivalent overhead) and meaningful to the client (not internal jargon)

**To resolve:** A concrete template for the first weekly outcome report, designed for UWI as the test case, that can be validated through 4-6 weeks of empirical use before standardizing.

### 3. The ideal trajectory where success fee outcompetes the base retainer
⏱️ 10 min

The design doc describes a lifecycle: base retainer bridges the early period, success fee grows as the client generates revenue from the AI function, and eventually the success component outcompetes the fixed base. The retainer is a "Dorn im Auge" for the client; the success fee is earned value both sides celebrate. When the success fee outcompetes the base, it proves the client has a new revenue stream that didn't exist before.

- At what ratio does the transition make sense? (e.g., success fee consistently exceeds 2x the base for 3 months?)
- Does the base decrease or stay as a floor?
- How does this work for sales engagements (UWI) where project revenue is lumpy vs. product engagements (Archibus) where subscription revenue is recurring?

**To resolve:** The mechanics and trigger criteria for when and how the contract structure shifts from base-dominant to success-dominant.

### 4. The success fee as a client selection filter
⏱️ 10 min

The success fee creates a natural filter: if the client cannot demonstrate that their business will be profitable enough to make the success component meaningful, the engagement may not be a fit. This inverts the negotiation — instead of the provider justifying the success fee, the client demonstrates their commercial viability.

- The obligation shifts: "Prove to me this is going to be profitable"
- This signals selectivity — Wilsch AI chooses its clients, not the other way around
- For the Archibus model: product revenue projections justify the revenue share structure
- For new leads: the design doc process (Workshop → alignment) already filters for seriousness; the success fee discussion deepens that filter

**To resolve:** How to frame the success fee conversation as a mutual qualification step during contract negotiation.

## Meeting Format

- **Type:** Self-facilitated extraction pass (JA)
- **Expectation:** Bring real data — Archibus revenue projections, UWI project pipeline, first draft of outcome report template
- **Outcome:** All four Undefined markers in the design doc resolved → defined
