## Introduction

**The Position Agreement is a crucial management tool that creates a solid foundation for managers and employees to work together.**

Position Agreements are written agreements between managers and the employees who report to them. Unlike job descriptions, Position Agreements outline specific work your employees agree to do as part of their job and are organized so they know *exactly* what their responsibilities are. With **Result Statements**, **Work Listings**, and **Standards**, you take the guess work out of every teammates' role, so you can build a solid foundation for them to work together—and ensure *you* get the results you want.

You don't need to create a Position Agreement for every employee right away. Your first priority should be creating agreements for employees who aren't performing well and for positions you're actively hiring for. Eventually, you'll also want to think about creating agreements for positions you'd like to fill in the future.

There are so many ways to approach writing Position Agreements. You can ask your managers to write them for positions that report to them, your employees can start the process by drafting their own, or you can begin by starting at the top or bottom of your organization chart. You might even find it more effective for one person or a small team of people to write agreements for the entire company.

It's important to keep employees' Position Agreements updated to reflect your current organization chart and the positions you plan to add in the future. The goal is to eventually create a complete management system, ultimately resulting in a team of high-performing employees. Whereas your org chart outlines the functions of your business and the roles it needs, your Position Agreements take your system further by adding more detail. This will allow you to measure your team's performance against clearly outlined standards and produce a system for introducing new hires to their roles.

## The Position Agreement Contains Five Parts

### 1. Position Identification

The titles of the position, the manager's position, and all reporting positions. The position identification shows where the employee fits in your organization chart and includes their official title in your company. For managers, consider adding the titles and result statements of their reporting employees as well, so they know how they can support their team.

### 2. Result Statement

This defines the *result* the position is required to produce. The result statement indicates what you want to have happen and why. It keeps everyone focused on the expected results of their positions.

### 3. Work Listing

This itemizes the work to be performed by the person occupying the position. It includes some combination of **strategic** and **tactical** work.

### 4. Standards

Requirements for *how* an employee should achieve the result and perform the work they're responsible for. Consider the position and ask yourself what does and doesn't work as the employee performs this role. Draw on past experiences, and use your frustrations and successes as reference points to inspire your standards.

### 5. Signatures

Both the manager and the employee should sign the Position Agreement. This indicates the employee's agreement to accomplish the results and the manager's agreement to support their employee in achieving them. Keep your company's agreements consistent in their format and language.

## Position Identification and Result Statement: The Big Picture

These sections (templated below) are essentially a fill-in-the-blank exercise. The position title, manager's position and any reporting employees' positions come directly from your organization chart. The results statements come from your understanding of the results you want this position to produce. You can modify the company-wide rules to fit your culture, or you can use the ones we've provided as a guideline.
