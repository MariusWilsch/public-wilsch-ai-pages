## Introduction

If you routinely struggle with tasks being missed, routinely overburdening your most capable employees, or taking on too much yourself, it's a sign that your business activities are tied to *people*, not *systems*. An organization chart reverses that pattern, identifying the functions, positions and responsibilities you need so you can create a clear structure for you and your team. It's the first step towards creating a strategy for how your business operates, so you no longer have to decide on the fly.

For example, "Lead Generation" is a critical function of your business. By identifying that function, you can ask: What positions contribute to generating leads? Then, you can associate *positions*—not individuals *based on personalities*—to that function; you can make sure every business activity is accounted for, and you can increase efficiency and clarity throughout your team. And as your company grows, your org chart will serve as a reference for hiring and expanding.

In this guide, you'll map out the functions of your business and then place your employees where they truly belong in the organization based on **specific business activities** rather than individual talent. It's the first step toward building a business free of people-dependency—including dependency on *you*.

## Org Chart Key

- A **top box** represents a **managerial position.** A managerial position is one that has other positions reporting to it.
- Straight, **vertical lines** represent **non-managerial positions.**
- **Connecting lines** link boxes to one another, to indicate **reporting relationships** between managers.

## Eight Steps to Complete Your Org Chart

### 1. Free yourself from your current organization chart.

If you already have an organization chart, tear it up. You need to feel free and unencumbered as you begin to create something new.

### 2. Begin with a title and the president's box.

Take a blank sheet of paper and at the top, write: The Organization Chart of (your company's name). Slightly below that and also centered, draw a box and write "President/CEO"

### 3. Draw a box for each major department.

Create a box for each department you want to represent at the next level of your organization. You should aim for two to five boxes at this level. If you have more than five, consider creating an intermediate reporting level.

### 4. Create each managerial and non-managerial function.

For each department, draw boxes that represent functions and work groupings to accomplish each result, such as Marketing. Identify the positions that do the tactical work of each function, then draw vertical lines to represent those positions.

When choosing your managers, remember to think about the capabilities of each one. How many positions can they reasonably manage? Remember, you're not thinking of the capabilities of a *specific individual*, but a realistic idea of how many positions that *role* should be expected to manage. No one answer fits every company in every situation, but here are some simple guidelines you can follow:

1. The more diverse the reporting position functions, the fewer reporting positions a manager should have.
2. As you move further down the org chart, each role can be expected to manage more reporting positions. That's because as you move down the organizational structure, work becomes more uniform and oversight gets less complex.
3. No position should ever report to more than one other position. In other words, a person can have only one manager.
4. Avoid redundant management, if one manager is only managing one person, then take a close look at both roles. Can these positions be merged to one job? Can both people be managed by someone else?

### 5. Create position titles.

Change each function or activity name to a **position title**. Managerial titles such as Vice President, Director, and Manager, are typically followed by the department name such as Marketing, Customer Relations, Finance, etc. Non-managerial position titles—like Bookkeeper and Computer Programmer—tend to be more specific, describing the actual work performed by that position.

### 6. Review and revise the organization chart.

Evaluate what you've created. Does it reflect all the functions and teams you need? Does it organize them in a way that makes sense? Does it look like the business you want yours to become? Looking at your business in a bigger, more future-oriented way may feel unnatural or uncomfortable at first—but stick with it.

### 7. Account for all business activities.

Make sure all the activities of your business can be found somewhere in your chart, even if they're not explicitly named. In the image above, for example, a newsletter-production system isn't named on the chart, but it could be part of Lead Generation.

### 8. Create the final version of your organization chart.

Keep it nearby and look at it often.
