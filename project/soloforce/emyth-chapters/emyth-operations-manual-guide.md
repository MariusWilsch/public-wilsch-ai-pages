## What Are Operations Manuals and Why Do You Need Them?

Operations manuals are the individual "owner's manuals" for every employee's position. They are the authoritative guidebooks of how you want things done in your company. Done well, they'll tell your people how to operate their jobs for *maximum* results.

As the authoritative guidebook of how things should be done in your company, they give you a simple yet effective mechanism for communicating a lot of information, and they give your people a sense of independence and "being in the know."

## What Does an Operations Manual Look Like?

Your operations manuals are made up of three distinct pieces:

1. **The "shell"** — the physical container that will house the contents of the manual
2. **Company-wide contents**
3. **Position-specific contents**

### The Shell

Starts with a large, three-ring binder. On the cover and spine, put the title: "Operations manual for (Position Title)." Ultimately, you'll have a whole series of binders — one per position.

Next, tabbed dividers to organize your manual into **five sections:**

1. **Company**
2. **Products & Services**
3. **Policies**
4. **Position**
5. **Systems**

### Company-Wide Contents

The contents of the Company, Products and Services, and Policies sections apply to **everyone** in the company. Everyone needs this information to understand the company as a whole, what you offer, and the general policies under which you operate.

### Position-Specific Contents

The Position and Systems sections apply to an **individual position**. What a sales manager needs to know is different from what the service technician needs to know. This information goes into the Position and Systems sections.

## Operations Manual Sections

### Company

This section gives you the opportunity to tell your people about your company and the "game worth playing" — why it exists, how it came to be, what it looks like now, and a view of how they fit into the bigger picture. It should give employees a sense of stability and growth.

**Documents to include:**
- Strategic Objective
- Company Story
- Organization chart
- Company history

### Products & Services

Every employee, even those that don't work directly with your products and services, needs to know about them to participate fully in their jobs. Pride of affiliation is important.

**Documents to include:**
- Descriptions of your products and services
- Positioning Statement and unique selling proposition
- Company brochures and product catalogs
- Basic information about your competition
- Documents that describe the logic behind your products and services

### Policies

This section spells out the "rules for your game" that apply to everyone in your company.

**Documents to include:**
- Employee handbook contents
- Benefits information
- Dress code
- Facilities code
- Individual policy documents
- Documents that describe the logic behind company policies

### Position

This section should give employees an overview of the results and accountabilities of their position.

**Documents to include:**
- The position contract
- Generic, blank copies of any employment contracts and/or compensation agreements
- Documents that describe the logic behind the position

*Note: The employee's own copies of actual employment contracts, containing specific figures and stipulations, are best kept in a more confidential place.*

### Systems

This part of the operations manual is like a "tool kit" where your employees can find all the instructions they need for doing the work of their positions. Include all the processes and procedures that you've developed over time for that particular position so that your employee can "run" his job by "running" its systems.

**Documents to include:**
- System action plans
- Documents that describe the logic behind the systems

---

## A Note About "Logic"

As we've described the kinds of documents that can go into each section, you see references to "documents that describe the logic behind..." **Logic** is any information that gives background or context helpful to understanding the other information being presented.

Instead of telling your people only *what* you require of them, tell them *why*, too. This provides the rationale that gives a more complete picture and will lead to better performance and better decision making. Explain the principles *behind* the work and you'll help them develop good judgment and play the game *your* way.

**Tip:** Include relevant E-Myth Mastery Program materials as logic documents. For example, add "Characteristics of The E-Myth Manager" (LD-0070) to a management position's manual, or marketing fundamentals excerpts for sales positions.

## Setting Up Your Operations Manuals for the First Time

### 7-Step Setup Process

#### 1. Make a List of All Positions in Your Company

Indicate how many people are currently in each position. Use your organization chart as the starting place. This gives you the big picture of how many shells and copies you'll need.

#### 2. Assemble the Shells for Every Manual You'll Need

At a minimum, you'll need one for every current employee. In addition, create manuals for:
- Upcoming and future hires
- Managers
- A company master

#### 3. Identify and Assemble Existing Company-Wide Information

Think about what materials you already have for the Company, Products and Services, and Policies sections. Gather existing documents that fit.

#### 4. Identify and Assemble Existing Position-Specific Information

Think about what materials you already have for the Position and Systems sections. Your managers can do much of the work to identify and collect these existing materials.

#### 5. Establish System and Accountabilities for Maintaining Masters and Distributing Updates

Before you distribute manuals, decide how you will handle master sets and distribution. The key principle: **consistency.** Everyone's manual should have identical company-wide contents. Every person in a given position should have the same set of position-specific contents.

**For company-wide contents:**
- Who will maintain the master set?
- Who will be accountable for approving changes?
- Who will be accountable for distributing changes?

**For position-specific contents:**
- Who will maintain the master set of position-specific materials for each position?
- Who will be accountable for approving changes?
- Who will be accountable for distributing changes?

**For all manuals:**
- Who will be accountable for actually updating each manual when changes occur?
- Who will be accountable for assembling new manuals when needed?

For company-wide materials, usually only the president or a very senior person should approve changes or additions. For position-specific materials, accountabilities are typically delegated to a departmental level.

#### 6. Create an Implementation Plan

Create a written plan for how you'll introduce operations manuals into your company. Introduce them to managers first with simple training and opportunities for discussion. Then introduce to everyone else — company-wide, by departments, or individually.

#### 7. Introduce Operations Manuals to Your Employees

With the foundation in place and your materials ready, hand each person their very own manual. Explain the "mechanics" — what each section means and how to use the manual. Emphasize the benefits of having their own collection of documentation.

## Keeping Your Manuals Up-to-Date

### 1. Create and Distribute New and Revised Materials, as Needed

Over time, you will be revising documents, creating new ones, and eliminating some. Distribute them with a cover memorandum describing the new piece and explaining exactly where to place it and whether to remove any existing documents.

When you create new company-wide policies, distribute them in a way that's instantly noticeable. Using a special format, wording, or color highlights importance and urgency.

### 2. Update All Operations Manuals, Employee Copies, and Master Copies

Also update any copies already built for future use. Electronic files can be stored using the same structure. Managers should follow up with their employees to be sure they are using new documents.

### 3. Survey Your Company's Operations Manuals Periodically

If operations manuals are not kept up-to-date, they become almost useless. Have your managers survey the manuals of their reporting employees periodically — twice a year is a good guideline — and do a survey of manuals at least annually.

---

## Take That Manual Off the Shelf!

No manual can be self-enforcing. No matter how intelligent and clearly written, there's every chance it'll become an elegant dust catcher unless its value is continually reinforced by you and your managers.

Your operations manuals have to become fully integrated into your business. You and your managers have to use them, refer your employees to them, review their copies to be sure they're keeping them current, and make sure that up-to-date information is distributed regularly.

Your operations manuals have to be "living" guides of "how we do it here" — a vital testament to your ongoing commitment to build a business that works for everyone.

## Why Invest Your Time in Creating Operations Manuals?

Your business may run reasonably well without operations manuals. But aren't you aiming for something more? Aren't you building a business that *really* works — without your having to run the whole show all the time?

If you want it to be *your* game, you need to take the time to tell people how to play it.

### Benefits

**They'll help you recruit.** Operations manuals will be a powerful communication vehicle about what we do here, where we're heading, and what the position entails. An impressive overview of everything applicants need to know.

**They'll help you train.** Your operations manuals will be filled with action plans, checklists, policies, and organizational information — everything present employees or new recruits need to know. Teaching employees how to do their jobs and get the best results will no longer be people dependent.

**They'll be your "business on a shelf."** If you ever want to sell your business, your franchise prototype will be already documented in your operations manuals. You can point to your shelf of manuals and tell a potential buyer, "Here's how my business runs. It's all tested and documented. And it will work for you because it's worked for me!"
