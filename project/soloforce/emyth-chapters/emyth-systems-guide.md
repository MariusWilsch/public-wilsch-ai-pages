## Introduction

**Did you know that the way you send a routine email is part of a system?** And so is how you assign tasks and hold your team accountable for results. Systems are everywhere in your business, whether you know it or not. The key to having a business that *works* is creating your systems with intention.

What we mean is that by not *intentionally* designing systems, many business owners inadvertently allow "systems" to develop that completely depend on themselves or their employees without even realizing it.

For example, if your accountant Mary is the only one in your business who knows about your cash flow and your Key Financial Indicators (KFI)—then Mary is your Finance System. If Mary goes, your system disappears.

But if Mary wrote down her daily routine and all the information she knows, you're suddenly creating a **documented system**. Think about it this way: What would happen if Mary left? What would you need to do to ensure that the business keeps running?

In this guide, we'll show you the nine steps you need to create any system. This way, you'll be building your business by *design*, not by default.

## The Nine Steps to Creating Systems

### 1. Specify the Result and Name the System

Starting with the word "to", write a clear, concise statement of the result the system is intended to accomplish, and give the system a brief descriptive name (and a code number if you'd like).

**Example:**
- *System name:* On-time invoicing
- *Intended result:* To consistently deliver invoices on time

---

### 2. Diagram the System

Draw out the steps in the system, showing their sequence and how they relate to each other. Use a simple box-and-arrow diagram with brief captions to describe each step.

**Example:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│  Input new client   │ ──→ │ Turn off client's   │ ──→ │ Set "monthly        │
│    information      │     │   trial period      │     │ occurrence" for     │
│                     │     │                     │     │ invoice delivery    │
└─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
Update client's first       Using [recurring billing     Set "monthly occurrence"
and last name, credit       program], turn off           for invoice delivery
card information,           client's trial period        under "invoice options"
billing address and         in settings so they're       in [recurring billing
email.                      billed each month.           program].
```

### 3. Write System Steps in Clearly Stated Benchmarks

You may not need this step if your diagram is already outlined clearly enough. Each box in your system diagram is actually an action: When you identify each action, you create the benchmarks that make the process clear and unmistakable for anyone who might perform or supervise the work.

In this step, you restate the work in a complete sentence that clearly communicates the work to do or action to take. Start with a *verb*.

---

### 4. Assign Accountabilities

Identify which roles—not people—are accountable for the system as a whole, and for each of its benchmarks. When you finish documenting the system, put a copy of the system action plan (Step 3) into your operations manuals. You may list your accountabilities at the very top of your system alongside its name/code number. In some cases, different positions will hit different benchmarks. If this happens in your business, make a note in your flowchart from Step 2.

**Example:** Account managers are responsible for monitoring the flow of invoices and updating the Recurring Billing Program. Account managers will update or input client information into the program.

---

### 5. Determine the Timing

The key to getting the results you want is knowing *when* each benchmark must be achieved. Establish appropriate timing for each step, certain steps only, or for the system as a whole. This might be expressed in terms of clock time (i.e. by 10am), project time (i.e. day one, day four), generic phrases (i.e. upon receipt, weekly), or a combination of these.

**Example:** When we have a new client, add them **immediately** to our Recurring Billing Program. Account managers will check stream of invoices for accuracy **at the end of each month.**

---

### 6. Identify Required Resources

Every system requires resources, such as staffing, work space, facilities, equipment, supplies and information. When it's useful, list the specific resources and the quantities needed of each to operate the system. Some systems won't have a lengthy list of resources.

**Example:** Resources: Recurring Billing Program

---

### 7. Determine How You'll Quantify the System

How will you know if you're getting the result you want from your system? How can you make decisions about your business without information about systems performance? You need quantitative data to give you that objective view—without it, you're operating blindly. The best time to create the method for quantifying each system is when you first design and document that system.

**Example:** Account managers will check all invoices for accuracy and percentage successfully delivered at the end of each month.

---

### 8. Establish Standards

Set the standards for system performance and staff behavior within the system. Standards are most easily stated in terms of quantity, quality and behavior. These could include measures of output, defects, cost per item, guidelines for staff behavior, dress codes and even ethical standards. If it's key to producing a successful result, you need to set standards for it.

**Example:** Each invoice takes approximately 10 minutes to check, and there are typically 25 invoices per month.

---

### 9. Document the System

Put it in writing. It's not done until it's documented. You don't have to create a flowchart to have a documented system. An action plan, video, checklist, and even screenshots are just some examples of how to document your system.

You'll notice that the example above was very simple and that a specific employee wasn't actually named as part of the system. That's the key to a great system: It doesn't rely on any specific person to get results.

## How to Determine What Systems You Need

For some people, identifying the systems their business needs is a breeze. It comes naturally to think about what steps it will take to accomplish x and what steps will get you to y. But if figuring systems out isn't your strength, you can try the "repeating question" technique:

What systems do I need to make sure *x* happens the right way (*I need* systems a, b, c.)? Then, what systems do I need to make sure "a" happens the right way (*I need* systems i, ii, iii.) Then, what systems do I need to make sure *i* happens the right way (*I need* systems 1, 2, 3.)? And so forth.

In the Recurring Billing Program example above, the system covers only one aspect of your financial department: sending invoices. But you may need to add more. What system will you use when there's an issue with your invoices? What about training someone to send an invoice? The "repeating question" technique will help you see what branches you'll need to create to achieve the results you want.

## Reflection Questions

Use these questions to help you think about the systems you may need in your business. Brainstorm and write down your frustrations, as well as your ideas for how to solve them. Then, follow the nine steps to start developing your system.

1. How do we track progress toward my vision?
2. How do we spot opportunities for growth?
3. How do we monitor the Key Financial Indicators of my business?
4. How do we communicate standards for effective staff communication, delegating and regulating, and accountability?
5. How do we create a delightful customer experience?
6. How do we create, improve and systematize the sales function?
7. How do we build awareness, image and credibility?

No matter the size of your company, the product you sell or the service you provide, having systems that run smoothly requires ongoing work to maintain and refine them. It's important to periodically revise your systems, which ultimately should include target dates, and the positions accountable for the creation or improvement of each system.

Remember the result you're looking for: a way to capture, organize, prioritize and manage the systems development. It may be that you only work with a few dozen systems for the first year. Or, you may work with hundreds depending on the size of your business and the resources you have. Use these steps to create and revise your processes. Your commitment to continuously developing your systems creates predictability and helps to achieve the vision you have for your business.

Imagine the possibilities if everyone on your team knew exactly how you want things done. With systems, you're able to focus on your leadership, entrepreneurship and the vision you have for your life—without worrying about what could go wrong. You'll have the freedom to step away from your business, if and when you want, knowing it can run exactly to your standards, even without you there.
