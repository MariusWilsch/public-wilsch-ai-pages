## It's No Secret: Systems Are the Key to Business Success.

Think about your ideal business, one that runs like a fine-tuned machine, that gives you time to spend with your family, take a vacation, pursue a hobby and the money to build a comfortable life. Imagine customers lined up around the block to work with you—and a team you can trust to take care of them the way *you* would. In other words, imagine a business that *just works* the way you want it to without you having to *do* the work. That's what we're all after, right?

In the past 40 years, we've worked with business owners to help them create these kinds of businesses. And we've learned there's only one way to get there: by developing systems that ensure your business runs the way you want it to, whether you're there or not.

But when it comes to systematizing your *entire* business, where do you begin? How do you even know what systems your business needs? The good news is, no matter how unique your business may *seem*, every business needs more or less the same types of systems. So, knowing that, we created a Program that walks you through the process—system by system—for developing the kind of business you're dreaming of. When you do it this way—when you build every system your business needs with intention—you'll create a business that:

- Has consistent, predictable cash flow
- Continually draws the *right* leads
- Always attracts great employees
- Gives you more freedom to have a life outside of work

So let's take a look at each of the systems and strategies you and your business need—and the very important order in which you should develop them.

## The Three Stages of Developing Your Business

Businesses, like their owners, are supposed to grow. We describe the stages of a child's growth as infancy, adolescence and maturity; likewise, you can look at business growth in these three stages. But unlike children, the stages of a business's development have little to do with age and everything to do the level of systematization in the business.

No matter how successful your business is on paper, you'll probably find—like most business owners—that you need to start in Stage One. That's because, if you haven't spent time thoughtfully and strategically designing the systems in your business to produce the results you want, growth can only happen by chance. And to get more of the results you want from your business—and more freedom to decide how and in what ways you want to be involved in its day-to-day—you need to grow your business with *intention*. The "three stages of growth" model helps do that, guiding you through each stage so you can reorient to being *intentional* with your systems development.

| Stage | Name | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Stage One** | Getting Your House in Order | Establish viable business model with solid foundation |
| **Stage Two** | Growing Your Business | Scale with improved systems and commitment |
| **Stage Three** | Freedom to Choose | Fully systems-dependent, owner freedom |

## The Seven Essential Systems

So we've returned to the initial question: *What* systems do you need to develop in your business? Well, as we see it, there are seven of them—**The Seven Essential Systems**—and they're made up of four **business disciplines** and three **business activities**.

If you look carefully at your business, you'll notice there's a set of **business disciplines** that focus on the *internal* operations of your business—the performance and development of the business itself. These are Leadership, Marketing (as a strategy), Finance and Management. There's also a set of **business activities** that focus on the *external* operations—the ways in which you and your business directly interact with and serve customers. These are Customer Fulfillment, Lead Conversion and Lead Generation. The four **business disciplines** provide the knowledge, information and structural foundation that inform the three **business activities**, so they can deliver a seamless and consistent customer experience.

## Transform Your Business by Developing Your Seven Essential Systems.

In reality, each of these essential systems is already operating in your business.

- **You're already a leader, whether or not you're a great one**
- **You already make decisions about how to market your product or service**
- **You already manage your money and your people**
- **You already generate leads, convert leads and deliver your service to your customers—whether or not you've given much thought to each of these systems.**

But remember, the key to building a business that produces the results you want—with or without you there—is to design each of these systems with intention rather than by accident, as so many business owners do.

In our Program, we help you get these essential systems working like well-oiled machines by breaking them down into individual, step-by-step processes across the three different stages of business growth, covering every aspect of your business from front to back. Each process is a system or strategy designed to solve a distinct problem in your business—so you and your business can grow, and you can be confident in the results.

So, here are all the systems and strategies you need to develop in your business—and the essential order in which you need to develop them.

## Stage One: Getting Your House in Order

In the first phase of developing systems in your business, the main purpose is to establish a viable business model with a solid foundation. When you get the right foundation in place, you can formulate strategies to grow in a stable, manageable way. We start with Leadership because we believe your business is a reflection of you. Without a clear picture of what you want your business to become and the life you want it to support, you'll never be able to build the business systems to deliver those results; your growth will be chaotic and your business will only succeed by chance.

## Stage Two: Growing Your Business

In growth, the rewards become greater—but so do the risks. The stresses and strains in a business are different during the growth stage than they are in the foundational stage; but successful, long-term growth depends both on a solid foundation of systems and a commitment to continuously improve those systems to adapt to the business you want to grow into.

## Stage Three: Freedom to Choose

A mature business has fully developed systems—it's *systems*-dependent rather than *people*-dependent. It operates reliably, predictably and productively no matter who fills the roles on the organization chart. But most importantly, in a mature business, you're free to choose how involved or uninvolved you want to be in its day-to-day affairs. Your business can operate smoothly with or without you.

## Next Steps

Now that you know what systems and strategies you and your business need and the crucial order in which you need to develop them, it's time to start working on your business. But you shouldn't do it alone. Key to the EMyth Approach is the importance of having a guide—a personal mentor who can help you start to think more like an Entrepreneur and less like the chief Technician of your business, who can support you in defining your vision and help you see when you've lost sight of it; someone who never forgets the results you're after and knows how to help you achieve them.

So find someone you can trust, someone you know cares about your success and will hold you accountable to doing the important work of developing the systems your business needs to thrive.
