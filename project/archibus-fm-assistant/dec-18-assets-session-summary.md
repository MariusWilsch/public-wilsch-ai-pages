## Data Entry/Collecting

### Chain 1A: Ad-hoc Entry

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | User-based entry inconsistent, mistakes |
| **Workflow** | Single asset creation |
| **Best Practice** | Asset codes follow IFMA standard |

### Chain 1B: Bulk Entry

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Days of work, error-prone, inconsistent |
| **Workflow** | Upload from Excel/BIM + sanitization |
| **Best Practice** | IFMA standard + validation (before or after via survey) |
| **Note** | Also applies to initial deployment of Bruce/Archibus |

**Notes:**
- Auto-numbering: AHU001 → AHU002 → AHU003...
- IFMA is recommendation, not hard rule (can vary by company)

**Question:** How to handle non-digitalized data (paper-based)?

## Data Quality

### Chain 2: Parent-Child Relationships

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Parent-child hierarchy broken, relationships not systematized |
| **Workflow** | Auto-linking by asset category |
| **Best Practice** | SF 200 standards for equipment categories |

**Examples:**
- Sprinkler → Parent Board (firefighting)
- Filter → Split AC (HVAC)

**Notes:**
- Category-based linking, not individual assets
- Scale: 1000s of sprinklers link to parent board, not individually maintained

## Operations

### Chain 3: Survey/Asset Tracking (Data Currency)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Asset data out of date within a week, labor-intensive to track |
| **Workflow** | AI push prompts + scan validation |
| **Best Practice** | Target FM-responsible person; QR/RFID for identification |

**Proposed Mechanism (Ian's idea - not decided):**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Trigger | Weekly prompt ("Monday update") |
| 2. Target | Designated FM-responsible person |
| 3. Action | AI prompts to scan/validate assets |
| 4. Compare | Check against system records |
| 5. Exception | Flag missing assets |

**Status:** Idea - needs validation

**Pattern reference:** Similar to [Anthropic Interviewer](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-interviewer) - AI proactively extracts knowledge from humans at scale

**Notes:**
- Partial data valuable: "even a quarter done saves money" (Ian)
- Adoption challenge: Cultural change required
- Target audience debate: Kaia: "I don't want to be bothered"
- Related pattern: Space utilization surveys (same push-prompt approach)

**Question:** "On whose account and with what effort?" (Kaia)

### Chain 4: Lifecycle/Status → Work Request

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Status changes require manual work request creation |
| **Workflow** | Status change → auto-generate work request |
| **Best Practice** | ? (not stated) |

**Open Decision:** AI vs Backend - needs discussion with Rein

---

### Chain 5: Meter → PM

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Manual PM scheduling based on readings |
| **Workflow** | Meter threshold → auto-trigger PM work order |
| **Best Practice** | BMS/SCADA integration |

**Open Decision:** AI vs Backend - Rein flagged this as potentially backend workflow

---

### Chain 6: Parts Suggestion

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Craftsmen order wrong parts, waste time going back and forth |
| **Workflow** | AI suggests parts based on asset type + problem |
| **Best Practice** | "Stupid-proof" - constrain suggestions to compatible parts |

**Quote (Ali):**
> "If you are responsible maintaining an elevator and the elevator needs some part and AI prompts you, these are the parts that fit in this elevator, which one do you choose? And then it checks... This part only fits latest models."

**Also includes:** Suggesting assets to add to work requests

---

### Chain 7: Reporting/Dashboard (Smart Insight)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | FM/Owner needs asset information on-demand |
| **Workflow** | Query → AI retrieves, aggregates, presents |
| **Best Practice** | ? (open) |

**Use Cases:**
- Compliance queries: "How many F200s per floor?"
- Status queries: "What's delayed? What's in bad condition?"
- Budget forecasting: "Cost to replace all bad-condition assets"
- Calibration tracking: "When was X last serviced?"

**Product:** Relates to Smart Insight (Miguel's correction: AI SHOULD do prediction/analytics)
