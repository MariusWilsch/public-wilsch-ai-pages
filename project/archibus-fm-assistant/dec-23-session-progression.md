## Focus Selection

From the 7 chains identified Dec 18, three moved into focus for March:

| Chain | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **1B: Intelligent Bulk Entry** | IN FOCUS |
| **3: Data Freshness** | IN FOCUS (absorbs Chain 1A) |
| **7: Smart Insight** | IN FOCUS (dependent on 1B + 3) |

These form a coherent sequence: 1B (onboarding) → 3 (freshness) → 7 (intelligence).

---

## Meta-Learnings

| Theme | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| **Partner value prop** | AI makes low-margin implementation work profitable |
| **Data access** | Cross-client analytics requires permission model |
| **March milestone** | Need to demonstrate something beyond September webinar |
| **Strategy** | Quick win → long-term value expansion |

## In Focus Chains

### Intelligent Bulk Entry (Chain 1B)

#### Baseline

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Days of work, error-prone, inconsistent data |
| **Workflow** | Ingest data (Excel, BIM, or other formats) → sanitize → validate against standards |
| **Best Practice** | IFMA standard + validation (before or after via survey) |

#### Who Benefits (Dual Perspective)

| Perspective | Pain Experienced | Value from AI |
|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **End User** | Manual burden, errors, slow onboarding | Faster onboarding, cleaner data, less manual work |
| **Partner** | Low-margin "donkey work", holds up implementations | Makes low-margin work profitable, faster implementations |

#### Pilot Opportunity

**FMM (Qatar)** - First Bruce BEM client. Co-creation approach.

---

### Data Freshness (Chain 3)

*Absorbs Chain 1A*

#### Baseline

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Asset data out of date within a week; labor-intensive to track |
| **Workflow** | AI push prompts → scan validation → compare against system → flag exceptions |
| **Best Practice** | Target FM-responsible person; use QR/RFID for identification |

#### Dec 23 Additions

**Proposed Mechanism**
Weekly trigger prompting a designated FM-responsible person to scan/validate assets. System compares against records and flags exceptions.

**Organizational: Designated responsibility**
Make it part of someone's job, not optional. Eliminates optionality that kills voluntary participation.

**Interface: Chat-based**
Replace forms with conversational AI. Reduces friction to near-zero.

**Incentive: Gamification**
Tie participation to visible performance and rewards. Leverages social motivation.

**Platform: Mobile-first**
Meet users on their phone, the device they already like using.

**Personality: AI-as-peer**
Give the AI an expert persona. People are more willing to engage when they feel they're talking to a peer expert. (Anthropic Interviewer pattern)

### Smart Insight (Chain 7)

#### Baseline (Updated)

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | FM/Owner needs asset information on-demand |
| **Workflow** | Query → AI retrieves, aggregates, presents |
| **Best Practice** | Immediacy of validated data; on-demand queries vs fixed dashboards |

#### Dec 23 Additions

**Dependency Relationship**
Chain 7's value unlocks only after 1B and 3 deliver clean data. Without reliable data, smart queries return unreliable answers.

**Use Cases**
Compliance queries (how many F200s per floor?), status queries (what's delayed? what's in bad condition?), budget forecasting (cost to replace all bad-condition assets), calibration tracking (when was X last serviced?).

**Cross-Client Analytics (Future)**
Potential to aggregate anonymized data across clients for regression analysis. Requires data access permission model.

## Not in Focus

### Reason: AI vs Backend (Technical decision required)

| Chain | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **4: Lifecycle→WR** | Flagged as potentially backend workflow |
| **5: Meter→PM** | Flagged as potentially backend workflow |

**Blocker:** Needs discussion with Rein (backend), not within scope of this group.

### Reason: Specific vs Broad

| Chain | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **2: Parent-Child** | Specific data quality pattern |
| **6: Parts Suggestion** | Specific maintenance workflow |

**Why deprioritized:** Chain 1B is broader and encompasses more value for March milestone.

Chains remain valid. Focus emerged from Dec 23 discussion.
