# YouTube Content — Re-commitment Decision Call
[[client-archibus]]

**Attendees:** Marius, Kaia

---

## Meeting Goal

This topic has been open since January with no resolution. Both sides are interested but neither has converted interest into action. This call decides one of two outcomes:

1. **Commit** — agree on a forcing function (recurring cadence, first deliverable date) and add YouTube content as its own docket item
2. **Close** — acknowledge it's not a priority right now and close #594 so it stops occupying mental bandwidth

## Pre-Read

- [YouTube Marketing Funnel — Execution Design](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/archibus-fm-assistant/youtube-marketing-funnel-execution-design) — roles, content types, and open questions from the January 22 discussion
- Kaia's internal marketing & sales action plan (agreed among Ali, Mujahid, Ian, Kaia) — please bring or share before the call

## Discussion Topics

*Starting points for discussion, not limited to these.*

### 1. Where things stand after January
⏱️ 5 min

We agreed on the content marketing approach in January — shorts, long-form, roles defined. Since then, both sides checked in multiple times but never scheduled the working session. ACHS held an internal meeting and aligned on a marketing plan. That plan hasn't been shared yet.

- January 22: concept agreed, roles assigned, February start planned
- ACHS internal meeting happened — marketing and sales action plan agreed
- Follow-up between Marius and the team never materialized
- Both sides stayed interested but neither activated

**To resolve:** Shared understanding of where each side stands today, including what changed since January.

### 2. Commit or close
⏱️ 5 min

The content marketing idea has been open since January without a concrete next step. Keeping it open without a forcing function means it stays in the same drift pattern.

- If commit: needs a recurring cadence and a defined first deliverable
- If close: #594 gets closed, topic removed from both sides' mental load
- No middle ground — "let's revisit later" is effectively close

**To resolve:** Binary decision — commit with a forcing function, or close.

### 3. Scope of Wilsch AI's involvement
⏱️ 5 min

The January design doc assigns Marius to demo tooling (SDK agents) and back-office (video editing, channel management). Whether Wilsch AI also co-drives the content calendar or purely delivers technical assets is undefined.

- Technical only: Marius builds demos, ACHS team drives what to produce and when
- Co-ownership: Marius also helps plan content topics and cadence
- This determines how much capacity Wilsch AI commits

**To resolve:** Definition of Wilsch AI's role boundary — technical delivery versus content strategy co-ownership.

### 4. Cadence and first deliverable (if committing)
⏱️ 5 min

If the decision is to commit, the forcing function needs a shape. What cadence can ACHS sustain for content production? Wilsch AI's contribution rhythm follows from that.

- Example: one video per month, reviewed at Thursday all-hands
- ACHS team defines their production pace, Wilsch AI matches it
- YouTube content becomes its own docket item alongside the bulk data entry work

**To resolve:** Agreed cadence that both sides can sustain, with a date for the first deliverable.

## Meeting Format

- **Type:** Decision call
- **Attendees:** Marius, Kaia
- **Duration:** ~20 minutes
- **Expectation:** Kaia brings or shares the internal marketing plan beforehand. Marius brings the existing design doc as reference.
- **Outcome:** Binary decision (commit with cadence, or close #594). If commit, Kaia schedules follow-up with Ali/Mujahid for execution planning.
