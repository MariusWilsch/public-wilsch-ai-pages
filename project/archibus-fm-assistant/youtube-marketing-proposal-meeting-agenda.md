# YouTube Marketing Proposal - Meeting Agenda
[[client-archibus]]

**Attendees:** Kaia, Ali, Mujahid, Marius

---

## Meeting Goal

**Core question:** Do we want to pursue YouTube content marketing for Bruce BEM?

If yes, we should also align on:
1. Content approach (shorts + long-form)
2. Starting in February
3. Who contributes what (initial discussion)

---

## Pre-Read

Please review this document before the meeting:

[YouTube Marketing Funnel - Execution Design](https://mariuswilsch.github.io/public-wilsch-ai-pages/project/archibus-fm-assistant/youtube-marketing-funnel-execution-design)

## Discussion Topics

### 1. The Opportunity

No established FM + AI thought leader on YouTube. Market is ready for modern solutions. Social media can build credibility and generate leads.

### 2. The Proposal

YouTube content strategy:
- **Shorts:** Before/after demos (pain point → solution)
- **Long-form:** FM thought leadership, brief Bruce BEM mention at end
- **Funnel:** Content builds trust → leads flow to Ian

### 3. Discussion: Does This Make Sense?

- Does this align with how we want to position Bruce BEM?
- Is this worth the effort?
- What concerns do you have?

### 4. If Yes: Who Contributes What?

- On-camera: Who wants to be the face?
- Ideas: What content topics matter?
- Execution: Who handles what?

### 5. Decision

Do we proceed with content creation starting February?

## Meeting Format
