# YouTube Marketing Funnel - Execution Design
[[client-archibus]]

## Problem Statement

**Need a scalable path alongside direct sales.**

Ian's traditional approach works but is labor-intensive (high cost per acquisition). Bruce BEM is the next-generation platform; the market is ready for modern solutions.

Kaia's insight: "1 out of 20 is not bad... which shows us that social media is important."

**The opportunity:** No established "AI + BIM guru" on YouTube. Social media can build thought leadership and funnel leads to Ian for conversion. Both paths run in parallel.

## Solution

**Content marketing funnel that bridges both philosophies.**

### Strategic Context

Two approaches exist in the team:
- **Miguel:** Educational seminars to change mindset, sell knowledge
- **Ian:** Targeted sales to decision makers, need clear metrics

**YouTube content bridges both:**
- Educational like Miguel wants (thought leadership)
- Feeds leads to Ian with clear funnel

### Content Types

**Shorts (Before/After Demos)**
- 15 seconds to 2 minutes
- Pain point → Solution (multiple angles):
  - AI solution (Claude Cowork, SDK agents)
  - Bruce BEM feature
  - Smart process improvement
- Examples: Equipment codes, ticket creation, SSID entry
- *Content angles to be brainstormed with team*

**Long-form (Thought Leadership)**
- 10-15 minutes, FM best practices
- Ali/Mujahid explaining good CAFM management
- Non-salesy educational content throughout
- Brief mention at the end: "This is how we implement it in Bruce BEM"
- Viewers who stay to the end learn about us - that's the reward for attention

### How This Serves Sales

**Two modes:**

1. **Active funnel:** Viewer discovers shorts → watches more → seeks contact → Ian converts

2. **Passive credibility:** Prospect researches company → finds content library → thinks "these guys know their stuff"

**Key:** We're not trying to monetize YouTube. The content IS the credibility.

## Roles

**Two role types needed:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ideators** | Domain expertise, content ideas, on-camera talent |
| **Executors** | Back-office: tooling, production, channel management |

### Proposed Structure
- **Ali, Mujahid, Kaia:** Ideators + on-camera
- **Marius:** Demo tooling (SDK agents), Claude training
- **Ian:** Sales conversion (unchanged)

### Open Question
Execution capacity beyond Marius - who handles YouTube management, video editing, admin coordination?

## Success Definition

**What we're trying to achieve:**
- Content library that demonstrates expertise
- Thought leadership position in AI + FM space
- Leads flowing to Ian from a new channel

**How we'll know it's working:**
- People entering the funnel (signing up for... TBD)

---

## What We Still Need to Define

- The funnel endpoint (what do they sign up for?)
- The CTA mechanism (website form? Booking link?)
- How to track YouTube → lead attribution
- Execution capacity / role assignments
- Timeline for first content

*These gaps are expected. Get buy-in first, define details as we go.*
