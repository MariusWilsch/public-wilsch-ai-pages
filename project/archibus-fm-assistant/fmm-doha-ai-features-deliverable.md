**Re:** FMM Doha Airport AI Quotation

## Executive Summary

As requested, here is the breakdown of AI features deliverable within the 2-month timeline:

- **7 AI features** confirmed for March delivery
- **1 feature ready now** (Work Requests via Chat) - available for demo
- **6 features in development** (Asset Classification, Hierarchy Creation, Legacy Data Mapping, Duplicate Detection, Naming Standardization)
- **Pricing:** Our quotation calculator requires FMM-specific inputs to generate accurate costs:
  - Number of users by role (Self-Service, FM-Professional, Manager, Corporate)
  - Expected AI usage frequency per role
  - Deployment model (Landlord/OSP/Tenant)

  **Proposed:** 15-20 min call to walk through these inputs together and finalize pricing on the spot.

## Feature Scope

### Included in FMM March Deliverable (7 Features)

#### Ready Now

| ID | Feature | Description |
|----|---------|-------------|
| **MH8** | Work Requests via Chat | CAFM operator creates work requests through natural language chat. "Zone C needs cleaning" → AI finds asset → creates work request. Voice input available (polishing in progress, ready by March). |

#### AI Bulk Data Entry (Prototype Feb, Production March)

*The following 6 features are part of the AI Bulk Data Entry tool. Primary focus: client onboarding. Can also support ongoing data maintenance.*

| ID | Feature | Description |
|----|---------|-------------|
| **MH1** | Asset Classification | Normalize messy asset names to standard codes. |
| **MH2** | Asset Hierarchy Creation | Auto-build Building → Floor → Room → Asset relationships from flat data. |
| **MH3** | Auto-Population of Mandatory Fields | AI infers trade, criticality, PM procedure during import. |
| **MH4** | Intelligent Legacy Data Mapping | AI proposes column-to-column mapping between source and Bruce BEM schema. |
| **SH1** | Duplicate Asset Detection | Identify same asset under different names during import. |
| **SH2** | Inconsistent Naming Detection | Flag spelling variations and abbreviations in asset data. |

### Future Direction (Not in March Scope)

Smart Insight umbrella (10 features including Predictive Maintenance, AI Dashboards, SLA Breach Prediction) - requires historical data foundation first.

## Timeline

### What You Can Tell the Client

| When | What FMM Can Expect |
|------|---------------------|
| **Now** | Work Requests via Chat (MH8) - ready to demonstrate to client |
| **February** | AI Bulk Data Entry prototype - demo-ready for client review and feedback |
| **March** | Full production deployment - all 7 AI features live in FMM environment |

## Pricing

### Pricing Status

**MH8 (Work Requests via Chat)**
- Ready to price: Per-resolution model available
- Cost basis: Cloud API usage (predictable, scalable)

**AI Bulk Data Entry (MH1-4, SH1-2)**
- Requires input variables to calculate accurately using our quotation tool

### Proposed: Short Call to Finalize Pricing

The calculator needs FMM-specific usage inputs:
- User counts by role
- Expected AI usage frequency
- Deployment model

I understand some of this information might be new to you as well - we can figure it out together during the call, and escalate to Miguel where needed.

**15-20 minutes:** You provide what you know, I input live, we get the pricing on the spot.

## Next Steps

1. **Review this document** - Let me know if anything needs clarification on features or timeline
2. **Schedule pricing call** - 15-20 min to finalize costs together
3. **Demo MH8** - Happy to demonstrate Work Requests via Chat whenever convenient

Looking forward to getting this finalized for the FMM proposal.

Best,
Marius
