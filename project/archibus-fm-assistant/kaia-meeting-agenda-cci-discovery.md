# Kaia Meeting Agenda - CCI Discovery Session
[[client-archibus]]

**Attendees:** Kaia, Marius

---

## Meeting Goal

**Understand CCI from your perspective** - learn your workflow, what you do manually, where AI could help.

This is a discovery session, not a solution presentation.

---

## Pre-Read

**For Kaia:** None required - you're the expert.

---

## My Current Understanding

Based on the CCI documentation, here's what I understand so far (please correct me):

- **CCI classifies construction objects** - buildings, spaces, components
- **Hierarchical codes:** Functional System → Technical System → Component
- **Example:** A window in a wall becomes `-B01.BD01.QQA01`
- **Properties can be added:** dimensions, materials, performance specs

**What I don't know yet:**
- How you actually use this day-to-day
- What your input data looks like
- Where AI could realistically help

## Discussion Topics

### 1. Current Workflow
Walk me through how you generate CCI codes today.

### 2. The Pain
What takes time? Where do mistakes happen?

### 3. Example
Show real input → expected output.

### 4. Scope
Which CCI tables do you work with? How detailed do codes need to be?

## Decision

No decisions this meeting - just understanding.

Output: Transcript that feeds into design doc creation.

## Meeting Format

- **Type:** Discovery / walkthrough
- **Duration:** ~45 minutes
- **Expectation:** You teach, I learn. Screen share if possible.
