# CCI Code Generation - Discovery Meeting
[[client-archibus]]

**Attendees:** Kaia, Marius

---

## Meeting Goal

Explore whether AI can help automate CCI code generation by understanding the current manual process.

---

## Current Understanding

Based on the CCI documentation:

- **CCI classifies construction objects** - buildings, spaces, components
- **Hierarchical codes:** Functional System → Technical System → Component
- **Example:** A window in a wall becomes `-B01.BD01.QQA01`
- **Properties can be added:** dimensions, materials, performance specs

**Still unclear:**
- The day-to-day workflow
- What input data looks like
- Where the manual effort is

---

## Discussion Topics

### 1. Current Workflow
How are CCI codes generated today? What does the process look like?

### 2. The Pain Points
What takes the most time? Where do mistakes happen?

### 3. Example
Walk through a real example: input → expected output.

### 4. Scope
Which CCI tables are used? How detailed do codes need to be?

## Outcome

Next step: Create a design document based on this discussion.

## Meeting Format

- **Duration:** ~45 minutes
- **Format:** Walkthrough with screen share if helpful
