# DGX Spark Infrastructure Platform
[[client-rekers]]

Design doc for setting up two DGX Spark units as a model-agnostic inference platform serving REKERS benchmarks and AVO MiniMax workloads.

---

## Problem Statement

Two DGX Spark units (GB10 Blackwell, 128 GB unified memory each) need to become a model-agnostic inference platform serving multiple client workloads — REKERS extraction benchmarks (qwen3-vl:8b, FSO seminar deadline March 27) and AVO MiniMax M2.5 deployment (future, undefined scope). The platform must support any model via a single serving container, scale from single-node to dual-node when interconnect hardware arrives, and remain accessible from any network.

This is NOT about the extraction pipeline logic, model architecture selection, or client-specific application code. This is infrastructure: how the Sparks serve models, how they're reached, and how they scale.

**Preconditions:**
- Two DGX Spark units acquired (NVIDIA reference design, GB10 Blackwell, 128 GB unified LPDDR5x each)
- Persistent remote access via Tailscale (network-independent SSH)
- CUDA, Docker, Ollama pre-installed on Spark 1
- Spark 2 in partial setup state
- Inter-node cable not yet purchased (seller identified)
- Memory bandwidth (273 GB/s LPDDR5x) is the performance ceiling — not compute or VRAM

## Success Definition

| Element | Definition |
|---------|-----------|
| **Goal** | Any model loads and serves an OpenAI-compatible API on the DGX Spark, reachable from any network, with a clear path from single-node to dual-node scaling. |
| **Success** | (1) Benchmark comparison table produced — same model, same pipeline, DGX Spark vs Power 10. (2) A second, unrelated model runs on the same infrastructure without reconfiguration. (3) Dual-node expansion path documented and hardware identified. |
| **Done test** | Can I swap a model path in one command and serve a different model to a remote client? If YES → infrastructure is complete. |

## Approach

### Part 1 — Hardware & Connectivity

**Spark 1 — verified 2026-03-19:**

| Component | Spec |
|-----------|------|
| GPU | NVIDIA GB10 (Blackwell SM121) |
| Memory | 128 GB unified LPDDR5x (119 GB usable), 273 GB/s bandwidth |
| Disk | 1.8 TB NVMe |
| CPU | 20 ARM cores (Cortex-X925 + A725, big.LITTLE), aarch64 |
| NICs | 2× Mellanox ConnectX-7 (4 ports total) |

**Remote access:** Tailscale — persistent SSH across any network. No VPN or local network dependency. Implementation details (IPs, interface names, SSH config) in project CLAUDE.md.

**Inter-node (future):** QSFP56 200G DAC or QSFP112 400G via ConnectX-7. Direct point-to-point, no switch needed for 2 nodes. Creates 256 GB unified pool. 4-node supported since March 2026 (requires RoCE switch).

**Spark 2:** Same hardware, partially configured. Same setup procedure as Spark 1.

### Part 2 — Serving Engine Strategy

The GB10's bottleneck is memory bandwidth (273 GB/s), not compute (1 PFLOP FP4 theoretical). Model weights must flow from memory to GPU cores every inference step. The serving engine choice determines how efficiently this happens — and whether the FP4 tensor cores get used at all.

**Engine ladder (simplest → maximum utilization):**

| Engine | When to use | Quantization | Docker |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------|
| [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/blog/nvidia-spark-performance) | Quick validation, apples-to-apples benchmarks vs Power 10 | Q4_K_M, Q8_0, MXFP4 (MoE only) | Pre-installed |
| [**vLLM**](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/vllm) | Primary platform — any model, single or dual node, vision | FP8, AWQ, GGUF | [`eugr/spark-vllm-docker`](https://github.com/eugr/spark-vllm-docker) |
| [**SGLang**](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/sglang) | Maximum single-node speed — NVFP4 + EAGLE3 speculative decoding | NVFP4, MXFP4, FP8 | [`lmsysorg/sglang:spark`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lmsysorg/sglang) |
| [**TensorRT-LLM**](https://build.nvidia.com/spark/trt-llm) | Production — NVIDIA kernel optimizations, pre-quantized NVFP4 | NVFP4, FP8 | [`nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt-llm`](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tensorrt-llm) |

**vLLM (eugr/spark-vllm-docker)** is the recommended platform because:
1. Model-agnostic — swap model path in one command
2. DGX Spark-specific optimizations (fastsafetensors, unified memory management)
3. Dual-node ready via Ray (when cable arrives)
4. Vision models actively tested by maintainer
5. Active community, updated daily

**Quantization pairing:**

| Model type | Best quantization | Why |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| Dense ≤32B (qwen3-vl:8b, qwen3.5:9b) | Q4_K_M (GGUF) | MXFP4/NVFP4 designed for MoE expert weights, actually degrades dense attention layers |
| MoE (MiniMax M2.5, Qwen3.5-397B, gpt-oss) | NVFP4 via SGLang/TRT-LLM | 90%+ of MoE parameters are expert weights — FP4 reduces bandwidth pressure 3.5× |

### Part 3 — Phased Deployment

**Phase 1 — FSO Benchmark (deadline: March 27, 2026)**

Run the same extraction pipeline from #1132 on the DGX Spark via Ollama. Produce the benchmark comparison table: Power 10 vs DGX Spark for qwen3-vl:8b at 72 DPI, 240 pages. Key metric: vision encoder time (40s/page on Power 10 CPU → expected <1s on DGX Spark GPU).

- Engine: Ollama (pre-installed, same as Power 10)
- Model: qwen3-vl:8b (already pulled)
- Risk: thermal throttling on extended 240-page run (monitor `nvidia-smi` temps)
- Output: fills TBD values in FSO presentation (#1081)

**Phase 2 — vLLM Platform**

Install eugr/spark-vllm-docker as the permanent serving platform. Validate vision models via vLLM, confirm model-agnostic serving (swap model path, same container).

- Engine: eugr/spark-vllm-docker (single-node `--solo` mode)
- Test: same extraction pipeline, then a second unrelated model → validates "swap model path" capability
- Dependency: none (can start immediately after Phase 1)

**Phase 3 — AVO MiniMax & Dual-Node**

Deploy MiniMax M2.5 for AVO. Start single-node with [FP8+INT4-AWQ](https://huggingface.co/mratsim/MiniMax-M2.5-FP8-INT4-AWQ) (~92.5 GB), expand to dual-node for larger quantizations or longer context.

- Engine: eugr/spark-vllm-docker (same container, `TP=2` via Ray for dual-node)
- Reference: [wshobson/minimax-dgx-spark](https://github.com/wshobson/minimax-dgx-spark) — dedicated MiniMax inference server
- Dependency: QSFP cable purchase (for dual-node)

**Phase 4 — Performance Optimization**

Squeeze maximum throughput from the hardware. SGLang with EAGLE3 speculative decoding (~2× decode speed), NVFP4 quantization for MoE models, CUDA 13.2 upgrade (up to 3× improvement for FP4/FP8 workloads).

- Engine: SGLang or TensorRT-LLM for NVFP4-optimized serving
- Explore: speculative decoding, batching strategies, thermal management for sustained runs
- Dependency: Phase 2 baseline established

**Undefined:**
- **Dual-Node Operations:** How are two nodes managed? One Tailscale entry per node or a cluster abstraction? Which node is the Ray head? How does SSH access work (one jump host or two independent entries)? Workaround strategy for known vLLM TP=2 + Qwen3-VL engine init failure.
- **Midburg School Datacenter (NSC):** Timeline, power/cooling requirements, persistent networking. Tailscale handles connectivity regardless — placement logistics TBD.
- **Docker Workflow:** Container management, model storage persistence across reboots, restart policies.
- **Monitoring:** [Prometheus exporter](https://github.com/ateska/dgx-spark-prometheus) for GPU temp, power, throughput metrics. Relevant for sustained benchmark runs and production.
